"The tv antenna itself is great, and picks up the channels it needs. The look is also great, and the fact that it doubkes up as a clock was certainly a good idea. The problem was the clock itself was too flimsy, and broke as soon as it got installed.  I didn't wanna go thru the trivle if returning as the antenna itself works, will just get hidden behind the tv, so as not to show the broken clock",neutral,positive

"Not sure if this was some weird IT joke, but they make you install a driver before it will work and they named their software XXX. Also the picture quality sucks and if your computer goes into screen saver mode it will connect/disconnect repeatedly until that Windows dinging drives you insane.

"The case is nice, but it's not very sturdy. When I bought it, the fit was pretty loose and it's gotten looser with a few months of wear, especially at the corner by the speaker. If I dropped it and the case was open, the iPad would definitely pop out. I'm careful with my iPad and keep it closed when I move it, but I should still buy a new one. It's better to spend a few bucks more and get something that fits well and will protect your iPad.",negative,positive
Got them for Xmas 2017. . . . 6 months later they stopped working properly. The ability to increase volume up/down does not work anymore.<br />The ability to stop/play/skip does not work anymore. They still power on/off and still play audio but if I wanted a headset that only plays audio and can't control features I would still be using a corded headset. I checked the firmware version via Beats website which makes you install an application just to check if the firmware is up to date. 100% battery + latest firmware yet problem remains. Searched the apple forums and seems I am not alone. If the item is under warranty apple will replace with a refurbished headset. Unfortunately it appears as per the forum on apple that even those refurbished headsets will fail eventually.,negative,negative
"The worst headphones I've ever had the unfortunate experience of trying to use. Thankfully I did not purchase these. They were given to me as a promotional gift with purchase for something else. I would not have even spent $5 on them, let alone $25. Here has been my experience so far.<br /><br />Took them out of the box, opened them up and put them on my head. Winced in pain from the &#34;pads&#34; pinching my ears because they're very stiff and are the style that sit on the ear instead of around the ear. Next, I tried to pair it with my laptop. The instructions are among some of the worst I've had the displeasure of trying to decipher. Here is a direct quote from them:<br /><br />&#34;The light blue light green flashing at the Wireless mode,it means enter Wireless match status,find the corresponding Wireless device name on your mobile phone, click on the device name for the Wireless pairing on the phone's screen, hear the sounds &#34;dingdong&#34; means matching success,the light blue light.&#34;<br /><br />That's would be somewhat passable as English if, perhaps, they would include instructions on HOW to get &#34;the light blue light green flashing&#34;. Somehow I managed to get it to do this by holding down the power button and then pressing the FM/MP3 button two times. The problem now is that THEY WON'T STOP &#34;the light blue light green flashing&#34;. No matter what I do, they seem to be stuck in this non-functional mode. None of my devices see them advertised for pairing and no buttons on the headphones, no matter how long I hold them, change anything. Plugging them in to the USB charging cable when like this does change the light to red, but &#34;the light blue light green flashing&#34; returns when unplugged.<br /><br />If you purchased these recently, do yourself a favor and return them. If you are thinking of purchasing these, DON'T. Run away, run far far away to a land of well written instructions (regardless of the language) and correctly functional devices.",negative,negative
"I settled on these after reading many reviews of many brands & models, yet I’m left wondering what all the hype is about. I’ll give these two stars for comfort, touch controls, and an accompanying iOS app, but that’s it. They sound like garbage and the different tips make little difference. They’re SO quiet, even at max volume in a quiet room, and what I can get out of them sounds tinny, with nothing resembling any kind of low end. Maybe I got a dud? I’ve no choice but to return them.",negative,negative

"I purchased this to use with my laptop when I'm in a situation where silence is necessary.  It takes a bit of getting used to, as a couple of the keys aren't in the same place as I'm used to finding them, and just today, two of the keys on the left the Q and W stopped working for a time. They're working again now, but I'm wondering when they'll stop and I'll have to send the keyboard back.  For now, it is working fine and doing exactly what I wanted it to do.",neutral,negative
"The case works well and it has kept the camera protected, the issue that dropped the stars was the fit, on anything moving the noise of the camera rattling inside the case was just too distracting. I will fix it with some kind of wedge but it would have been nice to either know of this in advance (can't re-record some things!) or else to see a small insert that would fix it included.",neutral,positive
The sound is terrible:(,negative,negative
What a beautiful idea. Can't stand the fact you actually moved some of the locations of the keys though. The spacebar and the end key in particular. Had no idea to check to see if the keys were layed out the same as a normal keyboard.,negative,positive
"Great case for the price. It's a little tight on my Thinkpad, but it zips up.",positive,positive
Their cable work.  They don't break down in a few months. They have enough current so your phone doesn't give a warning that the charging is slow. Worth the price.,positive,positive
Awesome memory card from a brand I’ve trusted for years.,positive,positive
nice love it！cheap and reliable.,positive,positive
"These headphones are very good to practice any sport but I was very disappointed with the quality of the sound. Also, the fact that are not noise canceling makes that even though they go inside of your ear the sound from outside is sometimes too loud for you to enjoy what you are listening.<br />I don’t recommend this to anyone that care about decent to good quality audio.",negative,positive
"Email if you want. They are closed Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Isn't that when most of America is off work and need troubleshooting? There is an ""American phone number"" that starts with +85.... good luck with that. The help videos are in such a crazy Asian accent you have to be Asian to understand the letters and numbers they are saying. I can't get my dvr to wirelessly connect to my internet so I can get the app to work so I can angle my cameras properly without running up and down the ladder. So far from what I see it is a very narrow angled lens. You won't see your driveway, you will see your car. If it gets stolen you will never see any details, only your car going away. The dome camera I have under my eves outside right now shows nothing but a fence post on my fence. It has been that way for 2 weeks. Good news is if that fencepost moves, the dvr is recording it. I however won't be able to call ghost busters in time because my app won't work because my dev won't connect because Asians aren't working until I go back to work on Monday which isn't at all helpful. I do see 1 tiny light at the end of the tunnel. If I go to the store and buy a 100 foot Ethernet cord I could just about stretch it from my modem to the dvr. Maybe if I tape it to the floor so nobody trips we might be in business.... Wish I had bought an American made product. Past the 30 day return window",negative,positive

"[[VIDEOID:f3fac6a7667e4b64bff161c20cd1328f]] These Sonixx BTX1 Kids Bluetooth Headphones (Pink) are my daughters absolute favorite. She is 4 and likes to play on her tablet a lot but likes the noise to be up loud and it gets to be too much for us, these save us! They are super cute and easy to use, and she dislikes headphones that go in her ears so these are great, and they have a nice cushioned ear pad for comfort. Also, I had gotten her wired headphones before however she would accidentally trip up or get tangled in the cords, and pull them by the cord to unplug and they ALL ended up broken. These ones she CANT do that to so I really like that. They have a ON/OFF switch, aux input, phone button, mic, and volume +/- buttons. I keep my daughters tablet constantly connected to Bluetooth for this device (which shows up in the Bluetooth list as the Sonixx BTX1 so you can easily know what it is), so all my 4 year old has to do is turn on her tablet and it automatically connects for her. Awesome! So she can us it all by herself! The only disadvantage is the fact that my child is so young she has no forethought to charge it so I have to make sure they get charged otherwise they will not be working when she wants to use them. They fit her small head perfectly on the smallest setting but do have the ability to get bigger as she grows. They feel a bit like cheap plastic, but she has been using them for the past 2 months with no issues so I am definitely happy with them!<br /><br />~Thanx~",positive,positive
"I bought this to monitor a new dog rescue.  I love the camera.  Set up? 1,2,3 done!  Nothing teckie needed. Tiny so its easy to put anywhere.  We put it under dining room table in room where dogs cage is.  This is what we need to monitor for our vet. So being able to auto set to turn on and off plus setting to auto record when motion occurs is perfect EXCEPT you cannot store any recording of ANY kind unless you pay for a storage plan.  Come On Amazon!!!! YES, you can buy a $54 module which hooks up to the camera but its twice the size, qhich defeats the "" mini"" Or u can just buy a blink that includes a storage plan.  OR take the $84 & go buy another brand.  The mini comes with a 30 day subscription for basic storage, then basic starts at $3.99 a month.  I will buy the plan for 2 months while I need to record the dog's cage behavior and then cancel as I wont be using the camera.  I had ALSO hoped to use this on the 3-5 occassions we have dog walkers in the home BUT again, without a continuous paid storage plan record.  Whats so odd is that IF you have a storage plan, THEN you can store to the cloud OR your own<br />YES, thete is live feed.  You can WATCH directly for 30 second intervals.  With a storage plan you can click to record for those 30 seconds.  Or you can",neutral,positive
"I recently purchased this tablet for a bit more than what you are getting it for here.  In general,  this tablet is well worth the price compared to many other tablets, such as Samsung and ipads.<br />Reason being,  the Rand McNally  tablet includes a trucker GPS system designed specifically for truckers, giving you specific truck routes along with restricted routes with weight restrictions.  It also comes with apps that helps keep the owner opp. up to date of his or her fuel cost and maintenance throughout the year.  This tablet also allows you to add android apps such as Netflix,  Dish Anywhere,  and others for your own entertainment (Wi-Fi connection required). I also have the luxury of using Microsoft Office on this tablet, which is a plus for me.<br />The GPS app stores all addresses that you wish to keep and also give each address a specific name for your own records. It is a little getting use to when looking for certain addresses, but I eventually caught on.<br />The reason I don't give it a 5 star is this: the window support bracket is not capable of holding the tablet in place when you hit a big bump. The magnets are not strong enough to keep the tablet attached to it. Mine fell off on three occasions,  but I'm looking into using a couple of velcro sticky to prevent it from happening again. The one other negative of this tablet is the dash cam.  It does work, but you have to manually tap record to get it started and it does not do well while the vehicle is in motion. The video is a bit wavy lb the edges due to the bouncing of the truck.  I have a separate dash cam for that use that cost me $40 a couple years ago and it puts out great video quality.<br />The Rand McNally  dash cam works great when you are parked and want to record while you are away from the truck (shower, eat, shopping ).<br />The tablet also has an option for an additional back up cam should you want to purchase the extra camera.  It also had the ability to do electronic logs for yourself and DOT certified,  but that too requires you to purchase an extra device which is about $200 more and you get six months free service for the e-log service through Rand McNally.  After your free use I think it is just under $100 every six months for the e-log service (quite a bargain considering I pay about $900 a year to use the company's device and service).",neutral,positive
"This is a thin cover, and feels better than many other keyboard covers that I have tried while you're typing. However, mine came in with ripples at the bottom, that make the cover raise up from the actual keyboard quite significantly. Annoying to say the least.

"As delivered, the device has a metal plate inside, covering the radio. This kills the range but the gizmo ""feels"" more solid, so Belkin added the ""improvement"". The metal plate can be removed and the device put back together with a drop or two of superglue. After that, the range is as expected. The device is seen as a BT Belkin B17 audio headset. It connects to other BT devices using media audio profile. I bought it to connect my phone to my BT-less car radio. It works for music, but not for the calls, because of the limited BT profile support. Effectively, the device is useless for my purpose.<br /><br />Audio quality is OK, but the mechanical construction is abysmal. The 3.5mm audio cable connector is so flimsy that even ever so slight touch  causes crackling. Power connector is only slightly better, so the adapter disconnects easily.<br /><br />I'm not recommending it. It is one of the gizmos that are not worth having even for free - too much hassle before a trip to the trash bin.",negative,positive

"I got this a few days ago.  The build quality is amazing.  It is super fast.  You get a lot for the money.  And this laptop uses high quality components (screen, RAM, SSD, etc), unlike other laptop makers.  I am using it with an external Samsung Display and Logitech mouse and keyboard (wireless).<br /><br />The first thing you will want to do when you get this is to update the drivers to the latest version.  Specifically the Network Adapter and Video Adapter need to be updated, to get the best performance.<br /><br />For updating the Intel wifi and bluetooth wireless adapter drivers, go to the Intel web page and download their software which will scan your computer and install the latest software for all the intel components on your computer.<br /><br />For the video card, you will need to go to nvidia's web site.  You download their software which will keep your video card drivers up to date.<br /><br />This is a really fantastic machine.  My previous Samsung laptop worked great for a couple years, but I ran out of space on the hard drive, so had to buy this.  My Dell, which I bought brand new, wasn't very good.  Problems.  My other current machine is an Apple MacBook, which is fine.  If you want to play video games, the Samsung is much better.",positive,positive
"The phone itself is a very inexpensive, AKA cheap, cell phone and so far seems to work fine. Getting it activated on Tracfone was a bit of a challenge, as their instructions leave a little to be desired.<br /><br />The Phone itself came in its original package with a free 2 year calendar and special discount coupons. The problem was The calendar was for 2011 and 2012 and the coupons expired in 2012. The phone was purchased in 2014. This could be one reason it was so inexpensive to buy.<br /><br />The Tracfone activation instructions were a little bit unclear as it said to activate go to the webpage and there was an activation page to go to but the phone would not activate properly, not matter how many times I tried to do it.<br /><br />I then tried to set the date and time but every time I thought I did it, it would revert back to January 2001.<br /><br />At last, after a few deep breaths and various expletives that were deleted, I tried again.<br /><br />I tried to Log on with the user name I provided on the activation page. Lo and behold, they did not know me! So then I went through the new user registration process and all went along smoothly. They even automatically updated the phones' date and time.<br /><br />Things are usually simple when you provide clear instructions.",neutral,positive

"My Nexus 10 worked fine for 6 months, and then something went very wrong. It started locking up. Then it started shutting down and it wouldn't turn on again. I noticed the battery would say strange things like: &#34;100 percent charged. 0 seconds.&#34;  If I unplugged it, it would shut down and not turn on again until 2 hours of charging. So I called support and went through lots of troubleshooting steps, including a full factory reset. Finally, it stopped working completely.  They let me return it and sent a new one.<br /><br />BUT after five months the replacement started having similar issues. It became completely unusable. Again, all the troubleshooting steps including full factory reset and uninstalling all the apps didn't help. I called Google support and  I learned that they would not replace it.<br /><br />Here's the problem (besides two Nexuses breaking within 6 months each). The 12-month warranty ends 12 months after the ORIGINAL purchase. If your Nexus breaks, and they send you a new one, the warranty is not extended.<br /><br />If your Nexus breaks after 11 months, then they will only cover the replacement for 1 month. They don't recognize any implied warranty that the new one has to work for more than one month. In my case, the second Nexus only lasted 5 months, and they took no responsibility whatsoever for that. Keep in mind each time a Nexux breaks and you have to replace it, you will lose lots of time and possibly data. Family pictures, videos, etc. They're a pain to back up when your Nexus isn't working.<br /><br />Rather than feeling responsible, customer support told me to contact SAMSUNG, BECAUSE THEY MADE IT. Ah, so when it breaks, it's the Samsung Nexus. But to Samsung, trust me, it's the Google Nexus. Samsung will charge good money if they have to fix it.<br /><br />SO if you want a tablet to use for 1 year, this Nexus was pretty good when it worked. I didn't fall in love with it, but it was cheap. If you want a tablet that will last longer than a year, I don't recommend it. Basically, Google doesn't stand by it.<br /><br />I would not buy any Google Nexus again.",negative,positive

"I had no problem using this device or downloading the related app.  I did a few test copies to and from the device and my laptop and had no issues with it or the adapter.  The accompanying device directions could be clearer.  The only other issue I have is I can't plug the device into my iPod Touch with the case I have - it's too thick for the connector to plug in.  This means I have to remove the case in order to use the drive.  I'm thinking about cutting out the bottom of the case to resolve this.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />The drive doesn't function properly.  I copied 400mb of mp3 music to it.  None of the songs would play using the drive's internal player or a 3rd party player.  Included in the music were 2 folders with additional mp3 files.  The folders copied over, then after the transfer was complete, there was nothing in the folders.<br /><br />The password protection is also incredibly easy to crack because it's not tied to the device, but to the app.  Just delete the app, then reinstall it and you have access to everything on the drive.<br /><br />You get what you pay for.

"I bought THREE sets of these (tiny ones and medium ones) for my home computer set-up. They stay on 24X7. None have failed in a year of constant use. I had other fans from a big box store that died in only 6 - 8 months. As a bonus, these fans are remarkably quiet.<br /><br />My major complaint is that at the highest setting, the fan still isn't strong enough to cool a laptop that has a heavy drain on it--an external 4K monitor, a wired modem, and a USB/ethernet hub. Two small (3x3-inch) fans sit about an inch under the laptop, but the laptop still gets hot even with the fans on high. So I'll still have to find another solution for the laptop. (Minus 2-stars) But the other fans cooling modems and routers are adequate. My wireless router is warm but not hot with a 5X5-inch fan just under it sucking warm air out on ""low."" And another 5X5-inch fan used with a powered external HD drive keeps the drive from getting hot when I use the drive.<br /><br />All in all, if your device doesn't get very hot (like a hot laptop), these fans are probably enough. But a very hot laptop will need something stronger.",neutral,positive

They either emit just static, or they skip and have tons of noise that make them unplayable.<br />2) This device does not play 24/192 files via coax, which is not stated anywhere I can see, and i would not have purchased it if I had known this (if you listen to this device without an external amp, or use a USB connection, this won't be an issue).<br /><br />On top of that, there are a large number of navigation issues, and issues transferring files to the device.  I won't belabor this in detail, but it just seems buggy overall.<br />The device is also heavy.  Really heavy.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I would say, in my personal opinion, this device is worth about half of what it costs to purchase.  I can't recommend it anywhere near full retail price, and I feel I wasted money I could have spent on something more useful.<br /><br />UPDATE (after owning a few weeks):<br />Today I tried to use this device, and it kept prompting me over and over ""do you want to allow this device access to USB,"" but not playing any music when I clicked Allow.<br />So I restarted it, and the device won't turn on.<br />I have never had so many issues with a brand new device.<br />Do not buy this.

"It took me 2 years to finally find a headset that I was happy with, and this one nails it!  Here were my requirements:<br /><br />In ear<br />3-button inline remote with mic that works natively with my Samsung Galaxy S3 ( no jays app or anything )<br />Good passive outside noise attenuation<br />Good sound<br />Durable<br /><br />I'm most excited about the 3-button remote :)  It works just like the stock S3 headphones, but the sound and outside noise attenuation are much better with these.  The mic works as it should.<br /><br />The cord seems to be durable, it is wrapped, but it doesn't appear to be any nice kevlar or strong fabric like the V-Moda's have.<br />The metal pieces are high quality, I'm very impressed with the design and the feel.<br /><br />I am no audiophile, but they sound really good.  There is a difference between my Sennheiser HD280 Pro's, but comparing over the ear to in ear probably isn't fair.<br /><br />For $25.00, these are definitely the best headphones in the arena.  I would have been comfortable paying up into the $100.00 range.<br /><br />tldr;  Buy these!",positive,positive
"UPDATE SEPT 23rd<br /><br />Below this is my original review... but after only a week of use, the zipper is failing. It's constantly catching on the fabric and being in a pain the butt to zip open or close. The zipper itself is starting to give and feel cheap, and like it'll break at any moment.. So far, I'm not happy with this product, and have to give it a 2 star. Find another sleeve if you want to go that route and not buy a case like me... this isn't the right sleeve for the mini..<br /><br />---------<br />Original Review -- ><br /><br />I know with the outside zipper this was by no means going to be slim fitting, but it was a bit bulkier than I had hoped. A little too much wiggle room than I want. If this was a universal sleeve for small tablets then I would rate this 5 star, but because it was labeled as a sleeve for the iPad mini, I had hoped for maybe a tighter more form fitting sleeve.<br /><br />All in all, not terrible, good material, just a bit bigger than what the picture leads to believe",negative,positive

"Couldn't be simpler. I used an adapter to match it to a 3.5"" drive slot. Put the combination in the machine, plugged in the existing cables, and it worked. No surprises. The hardest part of the operation was finding how to open the case on the computer. I had it set up to boot the thumb drive with the OS install, I was up and running on Linux  in less time than setting up a pre-loaded Windows box.

"I bought 2 of these and might send them back.  They are shockingly light weight, which doesn't have to be ""bad"" but i live in an old, old building with minimal outlets so am incredibly careful about what and how much i plug into a strip.  I have had and do have many and this one is so light it makes me a bit nervous.<br /><br /> But ok....but.  I got this to also charge my phone and tablet at night.  The reason i bought this, along with the long cord, was it appeared it would be fine to charge 2 things.  I also have a little lamp that has a USB plug.  On looking at the unit and paperwork they give 2 different USB charge strengths, none which is going to be sufficient for multiple items.<br /><br />On the unit it says ""5v/0-2.4A"" which i took to mean, as in the ad, there were five 2.4, each, ports.  On the pamphlet (with misspellings) it says ""5V-3.4A total""  Meaning?  Each port is .68 V?  Or 1 is 3.4A, then reduces per each port used?  Most devices these days need 2A +  This seems to mean the USB ports are old and kind of worthless for today's needs.",neutral,positive

"This would be great, but there is one major problem:<br /><br />They should never have used the mounting plate.  It should feature a standard three-tab mount for simplicity, size, stability, and versatility.<br /><br />If you want the plate, attach it to the tabs.  Otherwise, it shouldn't be there.<br /><br />Likewise, it doesn't even come with the mount required.  Oh, if you have a GoPro you certainly have such a mount, but when was the last time you used it?  Where is it?  Is it even functional?<br /><br />I know where my stuff is, but these mounts are infuriating.  Size matters here.  The shorter the better, for stability.  You don't just add an inch for fun, and then fit a loose attachment point there.<br /><br />Lately, GoPro has proven to me that they aren't actually paying attention when they design products.",negative,positive

"I bought this camera after having one of the Mavicas for several years - thinking of course that Sony has improved upon their features and design. I was very very wrong.<br /><br />There are several things about this camera that make it seem cheap, and quite returnable:<br /><br />1. Battery: The batteries (rechargeable AA type) must be removed from the camera to be charged. This is the most cumbersome task for the price of this camera.<br /><br />2. Lenses: For any other lens you must use a large plastic ring that attaches not to the camera's lens but to the camera itself. Any type of wide angle lens (I've tried several) causes the edges of the so-called ""adapter"" to actually be in the photographs. This is a very useless and cheap ploy by sony to make this camera versatle. With the plastic ring and then with your desired lens it makes the camera look like a toy. This is not ""my first Sony"". It is quite an embarasing thing to see and use.<br /><br />3. Flash Recharge: The Mavica never had this problem. It takes about 7-10 seconds for the flash to recharge. This is - again - a very embarassing thing about this camera... to have your friends sit there and wait for that ""spontaneous"" snapshot kind of loses the moment when I'm watching the flash recharge indicator blink...blink...blink... Rediculous.<br /><br />4. Zoom: You can't zoom in movie mode. This is the dumbest thing about this camera. You can't zoom in movie mode? Touted with such a great zoom and... well, 'nuff said.<br /><br />My initial impression was that this camera would be a professional, high-quality, Sony product. However, due to the curious shortfalls of basic features I was very misslead by the hype over this camera. There are other issues: 50% of all photographs - even in good light or on a tripod - are out of focus.<br /><br />And, of course, there's the classic Sony snapshot delay. Those of you with Sony cameras will know exactly what I mean. You'd think that after 7-8 years of this that they would fix that. Nope. In fact, on this camera, it's worse. I can't tell you how many pictures of the ceiling or the floor or someones foot I have taken because of this. Dear Sony; Fix this problem.<br /><br />I feel sorry for Sony over this camera. It should be about $199 when you compare it to the features and design of competitor cameras. Glad I kept the box.<br /><br />P.S. I just heard that the DSC-F828 (their brand new 8mp camera) was suddenly discontinued with no explaination. Perhaps they are finally rethinking (or thinking about) their design and usefulness.",negative,positive

The shelves were a bit wider than I had expected.  Since it didn't fit the TV I sent it back.  With Amazon prime this is an incredibly easy thing to do.  I'd keep Prime just for this one option.

"Let me first say the Blu-ray player part of this device works excellent for playing Blu-ray disc but at the time of writing this review find I don't like the BDP-S3500 very much. I am rather disappointed because it has so much potential and so many potentially wonderful features but some of them work horribly. The internet browser is a mess and not just because it does not support Flash but because it is very slow and time consuming. The Facebook app is completely insane and goes haywire and sticks on stuff and opens up things you did not mean to and causes you to delete or block posts because it does whatever it wants and not what you wish it to do and is quite painfully slow and that's an understatement. Maybe its because I bought a &#34;Refurbished&#34; 2015 model. Maybe it was not repaired properly or maybe Sony needs to go back to the drawing board but mine is a mess for any Internet browsing apps. Apps like Netflix, Vudu, Hulu, pandora and so on work excellent but the Internet browser and Facebook are horrible and stressful to use to say the least. I would like to know who repaired this model at the Sony factory and give the lazy tech a whack on his head. I can't believe this unit was fixed and I hope a brand new one won't do this if I return this one and get a completely new non-refurbished model. I hope this is not how Sony made this device to work or else they have a lot more work to do.",negative,negative

Had to go buy the required Rca cables which have been out dated for years. Awful customer support from Pyle.",neutral,negative
"My unit shipped apparently without any post-Windows 10 configuration for this market, so when I opened the laptop, the screen was rotated 90 degrees (normal, before drivers are installed) and with the OS language set to Chinese. I needed to reinstall fresh from a USB stick in order to get English as the install language, and installing the screen drivers fixed the rotation issue. Note that most of the GPD drivers are hosted on Google Drive (!), and sometimes the links become unavailable because too many people have downloaded the files. So I would download those early and back them up somewhere safe...<br /><br />The laptop is an extraordinary device - it really will fit in a pocket. It's heavier than it looks, though, so it doesn't exactly disappear when you pocket it. Build quality is seemingly quite good - metal case, clicky keys with decent travel, LCD with no dead pixels or uneven backlighting.<br /><br />The onboard 'mouse' is a little strange. The optical mouse is like a smooth trackpoint that doesn't move, but registers your finger movements. I found it pretty accurate for basic pointing and clicking. You can click it to register a left mouse button press, but it apparently doesn't support click-and-drag or drag lock, which limits its usefulness. The good news is that on the other side of the device, there are two membrane keys that can be used for left and right clicks. Because the left/right buttons are flat membrane keys, I couldn't touch-type to register them - I found myself wanting to grip the laptop with two hands, like a game controller, to operate the mouse and mouse keys in concert.<br /><br />The keyboard is very small. I was kind of able to touch-type on it after a few days of practice, but I still kept making mistakes, and at no time would I call the typing experience pleasant. After typing on the Pocket for a day or so, it threw off my muscle memory for normal-sized keyboards. I found myself having to retrain whenever I swapped between the Pocket and my MacBook.<br /><br />Which brings me to the general issue with the laptop - everything is so small that you end up wanting to plug in something else to compensate. The optical mouse setup is OK and makes sense given the size of the device, but you can just plug in an external mouse and not deal with the weirdness. You can avoid the hand cramps and typing errors by using an external keyboard. The screen is nice, but since it's so small, you might as well plug in an external display and not have to squint constantly or resign yourself to only using one zoomed-in app at a time. At that point, you might as well have just purchased a slightly larger laptop.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say it's a really cool novelty device, but - for me - the coolness of it doesn't justify the price, dubious support options, or difficulty of use. I think I'd be comfortable paying about a third of the current asking price in order to have a tiny laptop that's simply not very useful. Otherwise, for ~$600, I'd look at getting a Surface Go 2 if I wanted something very portable and underpowered.",negative,positive

"Edit 2: Well, the second workED great, now it's starting to have issue with walking and chewing:  If you click and hold, then drag, the dragging is erratic.

I tried this with having that PC selected on the KVM first or not.<br /><br />Then I thought maybe I should put the PC 2 connecting on the one one that gets turned off more often.

"I installed the doorbell about 3 weeks ago. In that time it didn't detect a delivery of a package at least 3 times (that I'm aware of).

"I don't leave many reviews, but I feel compelled to comment on these headphone since I'm so pleasantly surprised at the quality on offer at this price point.  There are a number quite nice headphones at even $30-40, but closer to $20 you're more likely to find tinny, lackluster garbage, especially for wireless headphones.  Though these cannot compete with some of the more expensive wired Shure and Etymotics headphones I own for overall sound quality, they hold their own remarkably well at ~1/5 the price.  Bass is overrepresented, which is not my preference, but what's there is not muddy; rather, it's surprisingly full, and it gives a lot of full sized headphones a run for its money. Sound isolation is moderate; these aren't earplug style headphones and they let in some outside noise, but there is definitely a significant reduction.  I can't verify the advertised battery life, but I get through a full day of heavy use no problem, and the controls are all conveniently located.  I've been using them much more than I initially expected despite owning several more expensive sets of earbuds with objectively better audio quality, as these are good enough for a lot of listening and more convenient.  I'd be happy with them at twice the price; at around twenty bucks they're an absolute steal.",positive,positive
"We are in a new house, the house wiring is perfectly fine. We had a regular doorbell, and decided to get a Ring. We connected everything as per their tech department, as I wanted to make absolutely sure it was all safe.<br /><br />Connecting to the network was a pain.<br /><br />Our bell transformer started to make an odd noise, so I took the cover off, and the transformer was so hot, I couldn't touch it.  Power off, disconnected, and called Ring. They told me to check it was connecting to the network. I told them, it has nothing to do with the network. They said replace the transformer, which we did...called back... same problem. ""oh you have a faulty unit. we will send you a new one out"".  We got the new one, and we bought ANOTHER transformer as per THEIR specs, and installed AGAIN. Press the bell... same again.<br /><br />We got the builders to check our wiring... nothing wrong with the wiring. The product just sucks. We sent back the doorbell.<br /><br />We put a regular doorbell back, and no fire hazard. What a surprise.",negative,neutral

Bought this as a gift for my (senior citizen) parents and opened it to set it up and load it with some photos prior to wrapping.

"At 1080p, there hasn't been a thing I've thrown at this card that has struggled. I almost feel like I'm not even letting it try so I may be upgrading to a 1440p monitor but I'm also waiting for G-Sync prices to go down. Shadow of Mordor runs on Ultra (despite telling me it needs 6GB VRAM so I don't know) and never dips past 60FPS, Skyrim loaded with mods dips to 40 in some crazy places but that's better than the 10 I was getting on my 660 Ti (and my mods aren't optimized well either), and hectic games like Cities Skylines and Sid Meyer's Starships/Beyond Earth do fine even if they're a little more on the processor side than GPU.<br /><br />I dislike Crysis 3 but it did well in most places and looked nice, and anything lower doesn't even choke. Even what's available in Star Citizen as of May 2015 runs past 50FPS on the highest settings. I'm extremely happy and it'll be difficult to pay less than $500 for a GPU after owning this thing. The LED, while it'll forever go unseen in my case, was a weird surprise and I never hear this thing's fans spin up over my game's audio. I don't believe coil whine is much reported with this card but I definitely have none and that makes me happy.<br /><br />Be aware the new Titan was released but costs twice as much and while it does perform better, I'm not sure it performs $500 better on its own.

"On paper, the device is good. It functions well enough testing between a PoE and some WiFi cameras it was able to autodetect. However, there are issues. At first, it was able to detect all 3 of my WiFi cameras fine. But then there was an issue, and adding the PoE camera deleted one of the WiFi cameras. After deleting that WiFi camera, I couldn’t get it back. I deleted the other 2, and they added back fine. But when I tried to readd the 3rd one, it detected one of the 2 that were already readded in the other device list (so it showed up in both), and then it disappeared. I tried manually adding the 3rd camera multiple times, but it timed out and couldn’t connect… Though I could still directly connect to that camera via its IP address in a web browser. After confirming I could connect via a browser, I manually restarted the camera, reconnected to it via the browser, and then failed again to connect it to the NVR. I’m a technical person. I do IT and programming for a living. If somebody should NOT have trouble with this, it’s me. But this was a very frustrating experience.<br /><br />After trying several different ways to add the camera back in, I decided to try and get a firmware upgrade. But it forces you to sign up for a mailing list before you can get to any firmware on the Amcrest website. Even if you click the “download latest firmware” button in the admin section of the NVR, it still takes you to that annoying link. Once you get to the list, a chat box pops up, and every time I closed it, it kept popping up with new chat names. Once I finally got through to the firmware file, I found that I already had the latest firmware installed.<br /><br />In the “remote device” section for adding cameras, I did a general device search several times, I tried searching above by IP or MAC address, and nothing worked for the 1 camera. All 3 of the WiFi cameras are Amcrest IP2M-841B. All 3 cameras are setup the same way, and can be connected to without any trouble through their IP addresses in a web browser. After what felt like 100 times restarting both devices (and a factory reset), I was finally able to get all 3 wireless, and the 1 PoE wired cameras connected. Here’s a weird thing though, all Amcrest cameras connected to an Amcrest NVR, and Amcrest is not an option for camera brand?? How does that make sense?<br /><br />Another thing that was odd was that when I first started up the NVR, the locale was set to Uzbekistan, and I had no option to change it. I reset the NVR to factory default while trying to troubleshoot my camera connection issues, and that time it did give me the option to choose locale, maybe because I was connected over the network instead of only on a monitor screen. Either way, I should be able to choose.<br /><br />It appears the real issues that exist with the NVR are mostly based on a firmware that desperately needs to be updated.<br /><br />I find it annoying that now that the cameras are setup, the “CAM Name” is set the same for all of them, and clicking edit doesn’t give me an option to change it. So when I go on live view, it’s a list of cameras all called “IPC” and I have to guess which is which. I want to manually name them by their location. This should be an option, but it’s not one I can find.<br /><br />When connecting to cameras in live view, sometimes I got an error stating ""login return time is up"" but after trying again it would connect.<br /><br />I like the live view controls that are there, but it’s not enough. I like the speed control with the PTZ controls. I often use Amcrest Surveillance Pro with my IP cameras, and I like the features it has, many of which seem to be missing from the NVR. For example, there are quick pop-up buttons on mouse over to capture images or record video of whichever camera I have the mouse pointer over. I have a 4TB SSHD installed, and it’s working as it should, but there are no options for manual record on the live view screen. I don’t get why that wouldn’t be there.<br /><br />Overall, I would say that the hardware seems good, and the firmware has potential, but needs a lot of work to be a solid and useful system. I only have the one PoE camera, so I don’t know how it would perform with many connected, but I tried it on multiple ports and it powered up right away. I’m hopeful that a firmware update will address these issues and add more functionality to the NVR.",neutral,positive

Using on a stock Harley Road Glide set of handlebars and the whole set up is solid and secure. Just finished a 1500 mile trip with it and it worked great. Wish there was just a tad more rotation which would allow recording with the middle of the road in the viewfinder rather than off to the side.

"I've long been a huge Logitech trackball fan.  It seems every generation gets a little flimsier, but the low price means it's not so painful to replace as an old Trackman Wheel.

"for straps that are exactly the right width, this product works pretty well.  However, because of the thin, flimsy plastic used in its construction, it won't really grip a thinner strap.

"I am on my third in this series, the K5400 being my current printer and it is just about 14 mos old. They all seem to go south just after the warranty expires. And they absolutely EAT INK -- except I discovered (too late) that if you never turn the machine off, you will not need to replace the cartridges as often. I think they are programmed to cue you that the ink cartridges are out based on the number of times it is turned off and on. More than theory - I have proven this over the past 4 months, when I have not had to replace one cartridge. (I would have gone through at least one new set by now). Unfortunately, these printers just don't hold up to normal office wear. Recently the little paper catcher broke off and now the printer is making horrible noises. The printer heads have had to be replaced once (happily those were within warranty but it required me to spend half a day literally on line with HP to get them to replace). I've sort of had it with HP printers overall and am now shopping for a new brand and printer.",neutral,negative

"This is the second ASAS ROG gaming laptop that I have owned.  I previously used and still own my JH73 that I purchased 8 years ago.  That laptop still works very well and has needed very few upgrades to keep its performance going.  I am actually giving the old one to my son to use.  Since my experience was so great with my first asus rog, the choice to buy another was a very easy one to make.  I am extremely pleased with this laptop and will highlight some of the things that make it such a great laptop to use.<br /><br />If you have owned other laptops then you may know how important the hinging is for the screen. I love that this rog is not hinged all the way in the back where over extending the screen will cause it to break.  I also love that the fans push the air to the back of this machine and run so efficiently that it never seems to begin to get warm.  This rog also has backlit keyboard that can be dimmed or turned off completely.  It has a hot key row above it that can be used to open your most used apps in flash.  It also includes all the usbs, hdmi, card slots, and any other item you can  want.<br /><br />I am not a hardcore gamer but games run very smoothly on this Laptop.  You can max out the graphics on your games and play without lag, jumps, or cutting outs.  The graphics processor flies with this thing and I am not left wanting more.  Even if I did need more there is room to expand this machine.  I could go further into specs but anyone reading reviews on this machine will know those themselves.  This laptop operates flawlessly and the only possible complaint could be that it is less portable than others, but if that is the issue then you probably want a 15&#34;or smaller and not the 17&#34;.",positive,positive

"The wall mount bracket comes in a a roughly 15 x 15 x 6 in box.  Very easy to unpack.  Assembly was straight forward.  The basic 2 shelf bracket was easy to assembly, there are two rods that is used and the shelves and the center column with the assorted spacers stacks up. At the end of the rods are end socket bolts which locks the stack up in place.  I recommend laying it flat on the floor to line up all the pieces when you tighten the socket bolts. This assure you line up with the wall bracket noted below and will be tight against the wall for the next step.<br />Next, the wall plate needs to be screwed against the wall.  In my case, I used the supplied 4 toggle bolts since I was in between studs.  Use the wall plate as a template to mark the 4 holes.  I used a 1 inch wood drill bit to make the holes in the sheet rock so they will accept the bolts.  The toggle bolts are large so they will be firm against the wall board when installed.<br />A supplied level was handy for aligning the wall plate straight down the wall.<br />Once you screw the plate to the wall, the next step is to set the shelf bracket on top of the plate and secure it with the two screws.<br />Fishing the cables and power cords through the center was easy.

"My fridge is electronic. We have frequent power glitches here and sometimes when the power returns after a brief interruption it is often briefly unstable with alarming flickering. I like the idea behind this surge protector. If the incoming voltage drops too low or gets too high it shuts down and does not let the power flow back to the fridge for 3 after mains power is restored. It seems to me that is plenty of time to let the voltage stabilize and also prevents the compressor from trying to restart while it is still under pressure. I'm pretty sure my fridge has circuitry built in with all its advanced electronics to do about the same thing, but for the low price of this device it seems like cheap extra insurance.<br />I know a bit about electronics and I'd say the interior of this device is about as good as I've seen. I'd like to see more robust components but this looks OK for the price. When the device operates normally, it has a green light. If the light is yellow it is restarting with the 3 minute delay. Remember that the power will not turn on to the fridge when you first plug this in. You have to wait for the yellow light to go off and the green light to come on. The two red lights are pretty useless. They are for under/over voltage and if they ever illuminate the device goes into restart mode immediately so the yellow light will prevail. Who can see all this anyway, since it is all behind the fridge? The green light is sufficient for me.<br />I'd say go ahead and get this if you are a fussy worry-wart like me.

"I didnt test it under the sea when I was in Hawaii. However, I like the size and the look of this camera. I would say that it takes OK pictures, and the qualities of the pictures are obviously lower than regular cameras at a little higher price ranges. The sizes of the pictures are slightly wider (similar to those wide-screen pictures), and I sometimes need to crop them to make them fit the regular printing or editing purposes. Overall, I think this is an affordable, sporty, and cute camera. I think it fits the needs and the purpose, but not for high definition pics.",neutral,positive

"While the vast majority of people looking to purchase these walkie talkies will never utilize their full capabilities, I thought that someone should point out just how versatile these little radios are as even the manufacturer does not get into much detail on what they can do. While I could go on for probably 100 pages on what these radios will do, here are some of the highlights.<br /><br />SIMPLE WALKIE TALKIES - The product's most simple use is as a point to point walkie talkie. The coverage of these is quite limited. Well under a mile in average circumstances. Using many different radios it is possible to relay transmissions from one person to another manually though to extend how far your network of radios can reach.<br /><br />GMRS REPEATER CAPABLE - Any US citizen is now eligible to set up their own GMRS repeater system. With a GMRS repeater (not included, obviously) you can extend the range of these radios for dozens or even hundreds of miles with a series of linked repeaters. These radios can be programmed to transmit on a repeater's input frequency and listen on it's output frequency. It can also be programmed to access multiple repeaters by simply changing channels. Just do an internet search for ""GMRS repeaters"" to discover the possibilities that are available with GMRS.<br /><br />HAM RADIO CAPABLE - These walkie talkies can also be used to transmit/receive on the 440Mhz Amateur Radio band, if you possess a valid Amateur Radio license. They will operate in both simplex and duplex modes, letting you talk from one radio to another directly or through one of the thousands or Amateur Radio repeaters located around the country. As with GMRS, you can extend the range of these radios by hundreds of miles through the use of repeaters. The nice thing about Amateur Radio though is that you probably will not need to purchase your own repeater system as there is likely already one in your neighborhood already running and free to use for non-commercial purposes.<br /><br />WORKS WITH STANDARD BAOFENG ACCESSORIES - These radios work with most standard Baofeng accessories, including chargers and speaker mics. They also can communicate with other Baofeng and Pofung radios and any other radios that operate on GMRS, FRS or 440Mhz amateur radio frequencies.<br /><br />WIDE FREQUENCY COVERAGE - These radios can be programmed to transmit/receive anywhere from 300Mhz to 470Mhz using the free software provided on the manufacturer's website. There is also other third party software that works with these radios that can extend their capabilities even further. These radios can be programmed with a standard Baofeng programming cable (get an authentic one, not the cheap knock off cables!)  and a PC. Just look for any software that works with the Baofeng 888. The hardware for this radio model seems to be identical with that of the TD-V2. You may also be able to program these radios using the free and versatile ChiRP software package. Google it.<br /><br />RANGE EXTENSION - As with GMRS repeaters, some business and amateur two-way mobile radios have a ""repeater mode"" which allows you to extend the range of your handheld radios by using the two-way radio and antenna attached to your car. Mobile radios can retransmit the signal from your handheld radios using 10's, 100's or even thousands of Watts of power. How much power you are allowed to use is dependent upon which radio service you are using them with (GMRS, HAM, Business Radio, etc.) . You can also use the cross-band repeater function of some base and mobile radios to retransmit signals from one radio service to another (HAM to GMRS, Business Radio to GMRS, etc.) . If you have no idea what I am talking about you should talk to a company that specializes in business radio systems or a licensed Amateur Radio operator to learn more.<br /><br />CELLULAR/LANDLINE INTERCONNECTION - Yes, you can even interface these radios with the phone system with the proper equipment, although the cost of that equipment will far exceed what you will spend on these inexpensive little radios. Again, talk to a professional as to how to set such a system up.<br /><br />Considering that the cost of these radios only comes out to around $10 each, it is amazing what you can accomplish with them if you spend a bit more time or money. I would highly encourage anyone thinking of using these for non-commercial purposes to obtain an Amateur Radio license to get the most out of these. No Ham frequencies come pre-programmed into the radios, but they can be easily pre-programmed with software to extend their frequency coverage. Happy communications.",positive,positive

"I did not buy this on Amazon, I bought it at Lowe's.  I have the unit hardwired.  Works great when I'm in the house.  However, one of the selling points to this product was to see and communicate with people at your door when you are not home.  This is where this fails miserably.  I have an iphone, just upgraded to a 7 from a 5 (I say this just to point out it's not my phone being too old, etc).  I get a notification on my apple watch that there is someone at my door.  I pick up my phone and open the app, which looks like it's trying to access the camera.  And I wait.  And wait.  And wait.  Both wifi and LTE connection does the same thing.  Actually, the LTE connection eventually works, but by then, the person has already walked away (which the camera videos nicely).  If you try to access it from a laptop, you have to wait until the recording has finished.  So, this defeats the whole purpose of this.  Other reviews mention that it takes the camera a while to turn on and you end up seeing a lot of backs of people - very true.<br /><br />There is live video, which works the same way.  I can't connect live video via wifi at all, I HAVE to access it via LTE.  And it takes forever.<br /><br />It functions nicely as a very expensive doorbell.  Looking into getting another brand of live video camera for actually seeing who is at my door when I'm away from home.<br /><br />Wouldn't buy again.",negative,positive

"Right out of the box the TV was way past my expectations. Deep blacks, great viewing angles, no reflections.<br />I tested very dark movie scenes at night and had no blooming that i noticed.

"If you've got a few extra dollars kicking around, and want to avoid the cheap $29.95 LED clock-radios, I'd say go for this.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me, of course, was the retro-like styling. The price put me off for a couple of weeks, then I said ""to heck with it"", and picked it up. It's got high visual appeal. And even tho the only person who will see it is me, it's still a nice classy touch.<br /><br />Setup was a little confusing, and like most people set up a clock-radio, I tossed the manual aside. How hard can it be? It's not really hard, but you press-and-hold a button on the back to advance the clock. That's normal for digital clocks, but I expected a stem for an analog clock.<br /><br />The alarm is set by rotating bezel counter-clockwise. There are little arrows on the bezel which indicate this. The alarm is somewhat imprecise; only one hand indicates the alarm time. If you want to wake up at exactly 6:07am, you'll be a little disappointed. It's is analog of course, so you set it for ""around 6:10"".<br /><br />No complaints on the radio. I attached the external antenna and was able to quickly and easily locate my FM radio. I do like the single-style AM/FM tuner. Sound quality was good.<br /><br />I've looked at other reviews, and several have noted that the clock dial is very bright. Perhaps production has altered, but I find that my clock dial is not bright enough! And I have enough electronics in my house anyways, blinking and solid LEDs are no real distraction. It's been ages since I've slept in real darkness!<br /><br />I do have some minor nits with it:<br /><br />The hour and minute hands are not very distinctive. The hour hand is a little thicker, but they're the same length. Or close enough that waking up in the middle of the night might get you a little confused.<br /><br />The alarm is 12-hours. So make sure you turn the alarm on before you go to bed, and when you wake up, remember to turn it off! Or else it'll go off in the evening, which is probably not what you want. Just a matter of user training, as I'm used to setting my alarm once, and then never touching it.<br /><br />It would be nice if I could play the radio while the alarm button was enabled.",neutral,positive

"I took this overseas for use as highlight/hairlight in a run/gun, one-man video production deal. It works, but you have to use alkaline batteries AND you have to have FIVE. Really?

Anyway, dropped it once and it shut off immediately. Thought it was gone. Turned off, then on again and ""presto,"" worked.<br /><br />Pros: lots of light for a small package, variable, tough.<br /><br />Cons: doesn't like rechargeable (1.3v) batteries, takes five batteries to run, mounting is weird and a bit flimsy.<br /><br />______________<br /><br />UPDATE: about this fifth time this was used, we went to set up a shoot (closeup interview) and this just doesn't turn on.

"My first hub was not working correctly.  The company contacted me and were extremely helpful.  They sent me a new hub at no charge with no return necessary.  This new one came quickly and works very well.  The only negative, and it isn't a big deal, is that when I close my laptop and reopen it, I have to unplug and replug-in the hub to get it to charge again.  It's already a habit and not a dealbreaker.  The great thing about this hub is that you can charge multiple items at one time.  I had previously purchased a hub at Best Buy for about $85.  Problem was that the power in and out were on the same side of the hub, making it awkward with the cords all crossing.<br />UPDATE: February 12.  I've tried using this hub for well over one month.  It annoys me to no end that if I close my laptop for a while (or overnight) and come back later, it won't be charging.  I have to remember to unplug and replug in the hub for the power cord.  I usually forget and suddenly find myself wondering why my battery is at 45% or lower.  Too late for a refund…  I've given up and gone back to my Best Buy.",negative,negative

The shipping container was undamaged as was the product container inside.  So I can only assume that the damaged case was packed right from the factory.  Amazon service is great (as usual) and a replacement was shipped right away.  The replacement arrived about a week later with no damage to either the outer or inner container.

"***********************UPDATE*****************************************<br />A day after receiving this adapter, I plugged it into my Iphone but couldn't access the internet. After MANY hours searching, I found out that some adapters require an external charge. On plugging in this adapter (attaching power cable for my phone), it worked again. So you'll need at least two cables to this--charging cable and RJ45 cable--to be online.<br /><br />Another caveat:  as other reviewers mention, the blinking lights on this tiny box are GARISH. I'd used it in the day so the lights weren't noticeable. But at night? Forget about it. I got a headache from the Citgo-sign hideous flashing lights... Worse, the light spills out at all angles of this thin-plastic white box. I'd have to layer it with ugly black Duck Tape (or something similar) to hide just SOME of the violently blinking lights. But most of the light spills out underneath where the cables connect, so no hiding that.<br /><br />Right now, I'm debating returning this since I can't use this at night--when I have the time to actually use it. But at least it allows for fast downloads/uploads (software updates...) when hard-connected instead of the anemic pace of wifi...<br /><br />************************ORIGINAL REVIEW*****************************<br />Since our router recently died and we're waiting for a replacement, we decided to try to hard-connect our phone to our modem. This dock allows us to charge our phones while at the same time getting online. I'm stunned at the difference in internet speed. Normally, I HATE using internet on my Iphone because EVERYWHERE it's painfully slow. In the US and abroad. I sit there waiting to see if pages will load, anticipating they won't. I just assumed that phones don't handle internet well.<br /><br />When I connected this hub to my Iphone, the phone began charging immediately. I had to go into my phone's settings to activate ethernet..., but once I did, the connection was 20% ABOVE the speed I'm paying for. I was so shocked I kept running speed tests. Internet on my Iphone is now at least as fast as on my computers hard-connected to my modem.<br /><br />For example, accessing files in the cloud on my phone used to take so long via wifi that I'd put my phone down on a counter, go do household chores, come back to the phone after 10 minutes, and the files either would still be downloading OR the connection would have timed out (file failed to download after all that wasted time). I tried doing the same downloads using this hard-connection and was dumb-founded. I watched my Iphone go from starting to download to being finished in seconds. I'm enjoying the speed so much that even once my router arrives, I think I'll keep using this hard-connection instead.<br /><br />I'm wary of these dongles/docks as half of the ones I've bought in the past 4 years no longer work. But if this one continues to work, it will be one of my favorite tech purchases. I'll update my review if anything changes.",neutral,negative
"Bought this via download from Garmin for my Nuvi 660, should have bought the card from Amazon as the unit cannot hold the maps on internal memory anyway. The slight update advantage of the later version on the download was not important - those roads have been there for centuries.<br /><br />We used these maps for a 20+ day driving tour of Provence, starting in Nice, and ending in Paris. Except for one mountaintop I went over (farm roads) near Gigondas that was un-mapped, it worked like a charm. It got us to our apartment in Paris precisely and without drama.<br /><br />Tip - look up the postal code for your destination instead of the city name, as there are multiple cities with the same name all over the country, like ""St Paul.""",positive,positive

But I was wrong.<br />I have pretty small pinned back ears and  it kind of sits well....But I don't dare move my head to look to either side or it quickly slides down and renders it useless.<br />Cheap price and fast shopping though.

"I purchased this Chromebook because I wanted to sit down on the couch and surf and watch tv.  However, I cannot see the keyboard.  When I purchased it, it stated that the keyboard backlit up, I cannot get it to do so.  Also, the picture showed more options on the sides of the machine to be able to add items.  I do not have half the slots they showed.  I believe I got an older version that they were selling out so that the newer version could get in, and they were using the same number on the computers.  I did not try to argue with Amazon on it because last time I tried when I ordered a specific version of a book, that was shown and listed for sale, I ordered the book, I got the old version of the book.  I complained to amazon about it and they blocked my complaint, said it was irrelavent, so I figured if this computer was not identical as shown in the picture they would do the same.  I have a very hard time typing without the backlit keyboards.  I have two for my desktops and my old laptop had a backlit keyboard.  I don't like non lit ones at all.  My bluetooth mouse that I purchased accidentally, however, really works well with this computer.",neutral,negative
"Yes, the product looks and feels cool.<br /><br />Yes, the smell actually works (I think) for the product.<br /><br />Yes, it is innovative and might really serve a need for (as they say in the video on the Amazon product page) ""car cleaning enthusiasts"".<br /><br />BUT, I wasn't too impressed at its performance.  It didn't seem to pick up dust very well, so I still had to use a vinyl cleaner to wipe away all the dust beforehand.<br /><br />What it did excel at, however, was picking up crumbs.  Of course I could have used my vacuum cleaner for the cracks between the seats, and I do, so it really was only relegated to other miscellaneous areas of the car --and I couldn't quite figure out the product's sweet spot.  There just didn't seem to be areas that Armor All and vacuuming couldn't clean, or areas that this product was required, but for those irregularly shaped areas -like door handles and gear shift boxes- it might serve a purpose, and it actually might work really well if you needed to clean up crumbs in a hurry and didn't have access to a vacuum cleaner.  (It might be a last minute ""date saver!"")<br /><br />I think that it actually would make a nice stocking stuffer for a car enthusiast, and if I had received it as a gift at Christmas, I would have thought it was pretty neat.<br /><br />Will I be buying it again? Probably not.  But would I recommend its use for certain people? I just might.<br /><br />Three stars for me, and perhaps four stars for someone else.",neutral,positive

"It's a nice iron but I'm not used to the iron surface not extended the whole way down compared to all my old irons and I'm constantly bumping the steam buttons when I don't want to be. It also says everywhere it's meant to use with tap water but you're supposed to ""drain all the water out and dry when not in use"".  When I went to register it, this model does NOT exist to be registerable via website/app/text/anything.  I emailed customer service in frustration and they said, ""sorry just don't worry about it, registering doesn't do anything anyway"".... so I guess I should be thankful for the honesty....  It arrived in it's own box and it was very beat up- the point of the iron had rubbed and poked through all the cardboard and is slightly bent and I had to use needle nose pliers to pry a flap of stuck cardboard rammed up inside of it.<br /><br />It irons VERY well, the dial just says Silk, Cotton, or Jeans so I much prefer when the dials list all the common fabrics. The two steam settings work very well but it's too easy to bump them.  The other reviewers are right that in almost ANY lighting you can't tell how full the water tank is due to the dark coloring. It will also randomly drip water when put into the ironing position without any pressure on the buttons and without any collected water visible just prior.<br /><br />I really got aggravated when it would auto turn off just when I needed it all the time, now I just do things different and try to do all my projects of multiples in stages so that I am ironing a bunch at once.<br /><br />I have recently starting making my first quilt ever though and there are times when I have to do a bunch of pressing of seams and I have to ""wake it up"" each time...

"This unit will run on batteries, USB, or with  3-volt AC adapter (not, alas, included, but you can get a universal AC/DC adapter very cheap). I'd recommend one of the latter two as it eats up batteries rather quickly.<br /><br />I found using the USB output to my MacBook Pro to be a major pain. The ""USB PnP input"" kept appearing and disappearing in system preferences no matter what combination of USB cables and hubs I used. I finally gave up and hooked up the headphone output to my ARTcessories USB Phono Plus  audio adapter (viz. https://www.amazon.com/ART-USB-Phono-Plus-PS/dp/B000BBGCCI; originally purchased to digitize LPs but its input can be set to phono or line level) and plugged that into my USB hub. That fixed the issue and has the advantage of allowing more input level flexibility.<br /><br />That appears to be the best way to use this. A DAC like the ARTcessories adds cost, but I have found it to be essential.<br /><br />With that issues resolved, using this to convert my cassettes to digital files was trivial. I'm using Sound Studio for Mac but any recording software (e.g. Audacity) will do just as well. So far the cassette transport mechanism works well and appears to run true to speed if you have a reliable power supply.<br /><br />Bottom line: works fine as a transport mechanism BUT you will have to add the cost of a DAC to get it to connect reliably, at least on a Mac. Fortunately, I've had the ARTcessories DAC since 2011 and it continues to work like a champ.",neutral,positive
"I got this to have internet in a shed 40 feet from the house. Instructions warn the signal will be less because of home wiring and line noise perhaps from air conditioners and other equipment. It did work and was easy enough to set up. But it reduced the speed far too much. Wireless worked fine just far too slow. If I had placed this inside the house it may have worked better but I didn't test it, I didn't want it for that. It was plugged in upstairs to my Comcast modem and the wireless box in the shed. Wiring did go from the house circuit breaker box to a box feeding the shed. While good wiring for power it simply drops its internet speed too much. I also tried the 1200 power line that wasn't wireless. It dropped the signal also but was about 15mbps. I bought cat6 cables for each end and there was no difference. Both did work. Both simple to set up. My situation was as expressed by others. Too far, junction boxes for wiring will reduce speed. Both would stream standard video, this 1000 stuttered with high def. For just web surfing it was good. I put a signal repeater in the window and have solid wireless and strong signal in the shed.",neutral,positive

"I bought these to listen to audiobooks on my Kindle so audiophile sound quality was not my goal.  Good thing too since music production was mediocre at best.  I chose these because they were the ""recommended"" earbuds by Amazon for the Kindle.  Bad on you, Amazon.  When rating the stars I was unable to evaluate the noise cancellation, if any, because they were so ill-fitting and uncomfortable I could not wear them for any length of time ...ditto for moisture-wicking.  They were not worn long enough for moisture to accumulate.  I too am suspicious of the 5 star reviews.  I am currently in possession of MANY different brands and styles of headphones and earbuds.

"No instructions of value. The operating system is clunky. Not very friendly to use, beyond actual programming. If you're looking for the cancel route button you'll be digging for 10 minutes to find it. This is not user-friendly programmed. I do not need a GPS that tells me what clothes I wear. I do not need a GPS that plays games. Yes it plays music or movies. I need a GPS that works as a GPS. I need to find the buttons accessibility. Some kind of a manual would be more helpful. Less BS extra programs. More actual friendly GPS actions would be better.<br />On the trucking side of the GPS I do not need to till it what truck it's in everyday. Not necessary. It is not necessary to locate GPS satellites who wants the GPS is set up. The clock is always 1 hour different and I continue to set it and it reverts back to whatever time it wants. Worthless finding your time zone. I am in Pacific standard Time and it continues to want to be in Central mountain. It's 1 hour difference. These are just a few of the things that just absolutely make no sense after resetting several times the unit back to base information. It needs an enema. Too much crap clogging it up.<br />Now that I've had a few months with it it continues to fail. I cannot set the time zone and have not been able to since purchase. Could not update it at all since purchase. It has gotten me lost in a major city. The gooey system isn't friendly to use like you think it would. The size is good it's a good size but overall usage of this product or wheel chock. Don't waste your money pretty damn sad even for a vehicle it's not advisable. Some of the programs in it could be useful but they're the low dollar no name where the hell did you find this programs.

"I wanted a portrait monitor next to the main display of my 27” iMac. I tried several highly rated monitors before this but they tend to looked dim and washed out next to an iMac. This is the only one I tried that looks as good or better than the built in display. The matte finish gives it a different look which is absolutely perfect for text (looks great for everything else too, but it doesn’t have the “deep” effect of gloss). The iMac display has a physical layer with a noticeable purple tint, while this display seems very neutral. It also seems to have much deeper blacks and more vibrant oranges. I’m very, very happy with it. You’ll need to use DisplayPort to run it at 60hz on an Intel Mac (which is a problem with a recent Mac OS update, not with the display). It’s not for gaming.

"I used these to organize my stereo/TV cables.  The 1"" version I bought accommodates 4 sets of speaker cables, a sub-woofer speaker cable, and a subwoofer power cable.  It was pretty easy to gather the cables into the tubing and break them out as I got to each component. You can use an ordinary pair of scissors to cut/trim the tubing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's really ugly.  Though it doesn't look beautiful in the picture, it's even more unattractive when you see it in person.  Of course that's just my opinion, but I think most will agree.  I was afraid that would be the case, but I was desperate for a solution.  This is MORE ugly than audio cables lying on the floor.<br /><br />The tube is pretty thin/cheap.

"I received this iPad Mini case very fast in plastic packaging. There's a light scent upon opening the package, but didn't bother me at all. In the plastic, you will get a case, a screen protector +cloth and a stylus pointer.<br />Love:<br />- First impression is this is lightweight, a pretty good case. The back is a poly carbonate plastic.The soft Microfiber inside keeps the iPad Mini screen from scratches.<br />- Love bold blue color.<br />- The closure with wake / sleep capability works well.<br />- The cutouts on the case line up and they don't interfere with the iPad buttons.<br />- There's also elastic band to hold the ipad mini and give you more security/protection.<br />Not so love:<br />-  It's not easy to fold it. The front cover is stiff, it easily opens but it will not fold behind the iPad.<br />- I personally didn't like the plastic back, and also it doesn't wrap the whole back of the iPad Mini (there's still some areas that are not covered which makes it potential for scratches).<br />- It can't stand well while in vertical viewing position.<br />- It's kinda bulky.<br />Overall, it's just an okay product for me.

"Okay, if you typically work inside, do not want this for still photography, generally stay on fairly level surfaces, and portability is more more important than stability, then this tripod may get the job done for you.  This isn’t the worst tripod I have ever seen, and what’s odd is there are some features better than I expected and other seeming oversights.  I have several tripods, some aluminum, some carbon fiber, some steel.  I use them for surveying, photography, or construction.<br /><br />Set up is best performed by just pulling everything out and locking it down. I think trying to level this thing on an irregular/Unlevel surface could be an involved process. The clips on the legs lock tight or are loose...minor adjustments are rather herky jerky.  Moreover, the pan and tilt on the head is comically imprecise and lacks smooth adjustments.<br />I used a webcam on this tripod and that is probably about as much weight as you would want to use without taking precautions for a higher center of gravity. I really think that if this tripod gets too heavy, it could get knocked to the ground easily if someone bumped into it or tripped over it.  Certainly no tripod is immune, but tripods with more weight are not as vulnerable.<br />I needed something that was highly portable for short durations and frequent use. I also didn’t want to spend too much money.<br />When I look at some of my other tripods, I am impressed with both their strength and granularity of movement.  A couple have built in levels, and they are all stout.  Now they cost a great deal of money, but one tripod I have had since 1997 and the clips on its legs still provide precise adjustment.<br />I don’t want to scare you off of this tripod if it meets your needs...it met my need but I was hoping it could be used for other things.  For the price, it’s not horrible but it is limiting.<br /><br />If it works for you, then it may be worth it.  But this is not a tripod you are going to grow with.",positive,positive

"Sadly, this flash doesn't work on the hotshoe for Nikon D7000, but works pretty wells in S1/S2 mode.  I have been debating returning it, but I might keep it as a cheap off-camera flash unit.  Paid about 2/3rd the asking price as of 12/21/12.  Overall, the unit looks good out of the box, but the facts are I was sorely disappointed that it wouldn't work on the camera.  Instructions are in true Engrish and not very useful.  I think I will try the Sunpak PF30XN for something that is an iTTL flash unit, but for a manual unit the Yongnuo is an average value.  It seems to me that the flash is made for a Canon out of the box based on the reviews, so advertising it as Canon/Nikon in the title isn't really honest.  The S1/S2 modes seem to be ok based on my first two attempts using it - so if you want a 2nd flash for a cheap off-camera unit then it's worth it if you can get it for 1/2 A C-NOTE OR LESS.",neutral,positive

"This band did well for the first few months. Very comfortable and easily wearable all day. However, after a couple months of daily wear the rubber started to loosen. The rubber loosened to the point were I woke up multiple mornings to find the pod had turned upside down in the holder so the sensor was facing up. Additionally, twice the pod has fallen completely out of the band while I was wearing it when my wrist knocked against something. Kind of funny to look down at your wrist to see you're wearing an empty watch band. Luckily I found my Fitbit both times. I'm still wearing it but no longer trust it. You get what you pay for.

"I could've easily bought a less-expensive external HD, but this one caught my eye. I bought it to go along with my new iMac 27"", and the finish is identical, which makes everything look sleek and integrated. 4TB is such a nice luxury to have! A tip for anyone out there looking to use this HD for files, music, etc AND TimeMachine backup: Make sure to go into Mac Disk Utility and create two partitions; one for TimeMachine, and the other for the rest of your files. This will ensure that TimeMachine doesn't capitalize all your HD space, and will instead be corralled into the size you specified. Since my iMac 27"" has a 1TB HD, I set aside 1TB on the My Book Studio, and there is 3TB left over for tons of other stuff. This drive is whisper quiet, and I would've given it five stars if it weren't for the insanely bright LED on the front. It's perfectly fine when in steady use, but when the iMac goes into sleep mode, the LED blinks so brightly, that it looks like a beacon in a dimly lit or dark room.",positive,positive

"I have been interested in Wi-Fi enabled cameras for years but they were always price prohibitive for the relatively limited real world usefulness they would really provide.<br /><br />But recently a host of Wi-Fi connected cameras have come on the market that offer enhanced usability and a somewhat lower price.  Logitech is the latest to offer a security type camera to the market with a couple of very special features that set it apart from the rest.<br /><br />Out of the gate the Logi Circle is clearly well designed and built piece of equipment.  Everything from the packaging to the documentation to the hardware is very high quality.  Nothing feels cheap or like it was an afterthought.<br /><br />The camera can be set up in a matter of minutes.  WARNING: when opening the package be careful as there is nothing securing the camera to the box once the lid is off so if you open it at an angle it can fall out unexpectedly.<br /><br />From there it’s a simple matter to plug in the charging ring. The charging cable is about ten feet long and is fixed to the ring at one end and a standard USB at the other.  So the implication here is that if you need a longer or shorter cable you will need to make other accommodations.  Bu the base and camera make it exceptionally easy to find a good viewing angle no matter where you place it.<br /><br />Then hit the app store and download the app.  The app will guide you through the setup process and connecting the camera to your Wi-Fi network.  It’s a very straight forward and intuitive app that makes the process simple.<br /><br />Then you set up an account with Logitech so that they can capture all your video on their servers.  Big Brother is in full effect here so if that is a concern for you you’ll want to find a different option as there is no way to manually delete your video from their servers.<br />But uploading the video allows for some of the cool features that make the Logi Circle different.  The app captures and makes it easy for you to access points in the day when something happened if front of the camera.  If nothing moved then nothing is shown.  Makes it very easy to see what’s occurred without having to scroll through hours of video, potentially missing a small but important event.<br /><br />It also has a day summary that condenses all of these moments from the day into a short 30 second video; also a very handy feature.  However, if you want to download an event there is no way to save the videos locally.  As a security camera this is a fail.  If you are a parent using it as a baby monitor and want to save a fun moment for posterity that’s out too.  So essentially what you are left with is a camera that you can use in real time and look back at event s for up to 24 hours.<br /><br />The video images have the common fish eye look because of the wide 135 degree angle of view.  It great for seeing a whole room but I would prefer a little less viewing angle for closer images.<br /><br />It also shoots only in 720P which is a bit surprising considering most smartphones are capable of displaying images in full HD.  720P is probably a minor compromise because the wide viewing angle gives up a lot of detail anyway.  Also, takes up less bandwidth on your network and less space on their servers.  But 1080P would have been nice considering it’s the video standard.<br /><br />And one of the very cool features is the ability to use the camera off of the changing ring.  The ability to place it virtually anywhere without a cord is a huge plus.  However, even in power saving mode the battery only lasted about 2.5 hours.  So, you sort of have to plan for times when you want use it wirelessly, which takes away a big chunk of the usefulness.<br /><br />It also has night vision capability but with some limitations.  The video isn’t as crisp as I have seen from other night vision cameras.  And at night you can clearly see six LEDs surrounding the camera lens that help it see at night. If you are using this for security the lights are a dead giveaway that there is something going on.  This seems like a really big miss considering infrared LEDs are common in cameras like these.<br /><br />Overall this is a very user friendly camera that makes it very easy for almost anyone to set up and use. But if you’re looking for more advanced features or want to save video images for later use this won’t fit the bill.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Super easy setup<br />Very high quality build and software<br />Simple to find useful video<br /><br />Cons:<br />No ability to save video to your phone or computer<br />Short battery life<br />Big brother is storing your video",neutral,positive

"Seems to work so far. Setup of this device was somewhat 'OK' after reading the manual. You CAN'T just plug it in for it to work - it has to be setup via a web browser on a computer first (near existing router/box/wiFi), then can be unplugged and replugged into another location.<br /><br />Gave it 3 stars because the setup recommends using &#34;_EXT&#34; at the end of the existing WiFi network name - which means - I had to then recconnect my SmartTV and other devices - which was an unwanted pain and took forever. This device should just use the existing WiFi network name and extender it (w/o setup) to save time.<br /><br />Somebody needs to invent an extender which picks up ALL WiFi signals and just extends them without the needs to do &#34;setup&#34;, &#34;configure new network name&#34; and &#34;reconnect all devices&#34; to it.

"I have a computer repair shop and I like to prop my door opened to let fresh air in when it's nice outside.

There’s a stripe of Velcro on one edge of the fabric and another on the opposite edge. That’s a problem, not an opportunity: this will never be a tube of less than about two inches in diameter. If you don’t fill the interior with cables, the cover fits loosely, which I don’t find appealing.<br /><br />Personally, I find the inability to snug this wrap up a major shortcoming and prefer to continue to use my Velcro ties. But if you have a fairly thick bunch of cables to cover, this might work out well for you.<br /><br />Jerry",neutral,negative
"We lose power from time to time due to storms.  One of my big complaints is no moving air.  I got this little fan for that.  It would be quiet but on low setting the whole frame rattles and makes a lot of noise.  Medium and high I don't get that noise.  Med/High the noise is comparable to a computer fan.  The rechargeable battery is decent.  It lasts a few hours when i've used it.  I would not recommend this for use all day/daily.

"The spacing between the ports is perfect for all of my usb cords that are a little funky shaped (gaming mouse, gaming keyboard etc.) The only reasons that I gave it a 4 star rating instead of 4 is due to the shapes of the power cord and connecting USB. The connecting usb cord only goes one way, while the power cord is an L shape and can go wither way. This is my first day with it, so I may have to update this review based on its performance/ longevity.<br /><br />EDIT: So after having this USB hub for a while I realized that if you do not keep it stationary and accidentally bump it you will screw up any connections made. I will continue to use it as I only connect peripherals and NOT my backupdrive which I have hardwired to my PC.",neutral,positive

"For most objects I photograph I tend to use a white sheet and off camera wireless strobes but I was looking forward to trying this as a more compact option. After using it I have to say I'm a little disappointed. Materials all around are about the cheapest they could be. The LED lights provide JUST enough light to be usable with the aperture wire open and a pretty slow shutter speed. They are constructed of thin plastic and the legs are nothing like the product pictures that appear to be aluminum; these are folder steel that slide into the body with no release mechanism, they just fall out. The drop cloth backgrounds are a thin and stiff(read: impossible to get the wrinkles out) flocked material that either absorb the small amount of light or in the case of the white one are an off-white that is partially transparent and makes images look horrible. I recommend grabbing your own material for a backdrop.<br /><br />Now, the way it all can collapse down and fit everything into the case, that is genius. I'm kind of disappointed that everything else included is such low quality when the light box itself is made so well. It unfolds and holds it's shape with comparatively adequate materials. The generous pockets allow either the all included accessories to be stowed or whatever you find to replace them. I think that is the way you need to go into this purchase; ignore everything except the box itself and decide if you would pay for just that or have the idea that you'll need to replace the backdrop and bring your own flash's.",neutral,negative

"This is a nice starter kit for home automation that includes a number of different remote monitoring devices. It reminds me a bit of one of those Whitman Candies sampler packs. There is a little bit of everything thrown-in. A water sensor, a door/window sensor, a light bulb, AC outlet and motion sensor.<br /><br />This kit is obviously aimed at the price conscious consumer and as such the quality of these various devices is pretty low. They are basically the same generic, Chinese devices that you can find under an endless supply of Chinese brand names that no one in the USA has ever heard of. As such, don't expect much of anything in the way of manuals, support, etc. Don't get me wrong, the products actually work. I definitely would not rely on any of this to protect my home or business though. It is really more for hobbyists to experiment with.<br /><br />Another thing worth pointing out is that the remote AC outlet is very tiny and can probably only handle a very small load, like a reading lamp or something similar. You aren't going to be able to use it for a coffee pot, air conditioner or any other type of high powered device. The remote light bulb is also very low power. It certainly isn't bright enough to light a room up or even read by. I have not yet been able to find an area to use it since it is so dim.<br /><br />On the upside, the app that you download with the hardware actually works very well and you can integrate the devices into a number of popular platforms like Amazon Echo, Google Home, etc. So, the system is very, very flexible. It also does not require any type of central hub like some of these home automation systems do.<br /><br />If you are looking to get your feet wet in home automation this is a nice, cheap way to get started. None of these devices are ones that I would recommend for ""mission critical"" use, but it gives you an idea of what is possible at a very low entry point.",neutral,positive

"UPDATE 2/5/2022 - I can no longer recommend this clamp, as the last one I purchased failed in a manner that leaves me wondering when the other 3 I have will likewise fail.  At the very least, I must be more careful with how much I attempt to tighten them, which is done to help them hold without slipping on very smooth stainless steel tripod legs.  That is, they remain secure, gripping around the tubular leg, yet may still slip up and down on it when they are carrying weight.  What is the flaw?  A bad knob design that finds the knob coming loose when tightened down very tightly.  Basically, the knob seems to be threaded on yet behaves more as if it is press fit onto the threaded shaft that drives the opening/closing of the jaws.  I say it seems to be threaded on, because when it comes off, the only way I can seem to get it to reattach is to screw it on in a reverse direction that would normally be the clamp opening operation.  If you look at the product photo, there is a small red circle on the side of the knob, suggesting a pin possibly holding the knob on so that regardless of which direction you turn it, it turns the threaded shaft to tighten/loosen the clamp, while the knob remains fully positione on the shaft.  None of the 3 clamps that I have are designed this way, so that photo either represents a new design improvement that has only recently been introduced or an old design that has changed and introduced the vulnerability of the knob to coming loose.  As long as it is working, this is a terrific product, but I no longer have confidence in it given this recent failure.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />I bought this Neewer clamp to replace my existing use of a SmallRig clamp for mounting an ASIAir Pro astrophotography imaging controller to the leg of the tripod I use for my camera and star tracker configuration.  I've long been a fan of SmallRig clamps and arms, and still favor the SmallRig arm design over that which I saw offered by Neewer, thus I ordered a small SmallRig Magic Arm to use with this Neewer clamp, and that combination proves superior in holding strength and versatility, by virtue of the Neewer clamp's crab claws and wider jaw capacity.  I very much recommend this clamp if you need to be able to attach it to tubing that doesn't exceed a 1.8-inch diameter, which I find to be about the largest jaw spread where the crab claws are still very slightly wrapping around the tubing enough to give a non-slip hold.",neutral,positive

"So I bought this little bundle having lost my wallet 3 times in 2 weeks.... one of the times in another state the night before my return flight!  (found it thank God).<br /><br />Anyway, it's super easy to use the app and was super easy to set up these 4 little items.  I used the card for my purse, the tile with the key chain hole for my car key fob and the 2 little button tiles for 2 of my TV remotes.<br /><br />The point of this review is:  you should know that you can buy just 1 of these things and finding your phone is an added free feature!  Score!  I thought I'd have to attach one of those buttons to the back of my phone, but nope!  So all you do is double tap the Tile logo on any tile and it will locate my phone anywhere within bluetooth range.  This is so totally awesome.  I don't have to log into a computer to find my phone and I don't have to stress out looking for it when my partner's not home to ring my phone from her phone.  All you have to do is double tap ANY Tile you own in bluetooth range and it'll ring your phone.  How great is that???!!  Can't find my phone?  Grab any remote and double tap the logo - BAM!  Can't find my phone?  Grab my purse and double tap the logo on the card Tile - BAM!  Really an A+ feature that Tile should really be clearer about when advertising their products..... like first thing.<br /><br />My review doesn't include how you find things when you're out of bluetooth range..... but I think there's an alert for your phone when you're about to leave your wallet somewhere, etc., or about to exit bluetooth range.... pretty sure that's how it works.  Anyway, just finding my phone and things around the house will save me how many search minutes (hours) a year???  And garners a 5 star rating on that alone.<br /><br />Anyway, we'll see in time.",positive,positive

"Took us awhile to figure out where to put this &#34;mini&#34; system!<br /><br />We wanted to use this in our living room since it is an open area where music would reach several other rooms. A mini system was perfect for the bookshelves there. When we opened the box, we knew we had a problem. The speakers would not even fit sideways in the shelf - and they are not small shelves! On to Plan B.<br /><br />Plan B was to put them in the family room. That, sort of, worked. Shelves there could handle size, but the wires for the system are too short to space things out for a nice stereo sound. So, asked an audio engineer friend to replace the wires to add length. That helped a lot.<br /><br />Once it was all set up, we starting listening to different types of music to see how well the system adapted the sound. It did well - from classical to jazz, they all sounded good.<br /><br />We thought the speaker light feature could be turned off - we were wrong ! The lights in the speakers are very, very, annoying. This is not being used at a frat party or dance club, Toshiba!<br /><br />Kind friend - the engineer - came back and wired our bookshelf Bose speakers to the system. Now, we can enjoy the music without lights.<br /><br />Overall, for everything we went through for what should have been a mini system, it is A good system.<br /><br />PS - Just noticed that Amazon has now added the word &#34;large&#34; to the description. Sort of funny when you see &#34;large mini system&#34;!",neutral,positive
"Product arrived on time. It does reflect light, but by no means does it reflect fingerprints. I could see fingerprints more with this screen protector on than I could with just the bare screen.

"The range is good and the video image quality is sufficient, but connecting it to a 9 volt battery is a joke. It lasts for an few hours at most. So connecting it outside is just about impossible unless you live in a really dry area where you could plug it in to an outside outlet. The AC adapter that comes with it is certainly not weather proof.<br /><br />If you are looking purely for an indoor camera to monitor a room (baby, kids, etc.), this would work OK. I suppose it would work OK to monitor your pool or something like that outside if you could plug it in someplace away from weather and water.<br /><br />I purchased two cameras wanting to monitor my front door and driveway. I have one aimed through a window near my front door. This works fine during the day, but at night the ""night vision"" reflects off the glass so I get no image. The other I was able to rig looking through a bedroom window towards my driveway, which is a well lit outside area. This one works pretty well even at night, but it doesn't cover my front door, which is what I really wanted. I had to move this second camera a good distance from the window so the night vision wouldn't reflect back.<br /><br />I do think the manufacturer is being very deceptive when they call this an ""Outdoor Surveillance Camera"". Sure, it will work outside with a 9 volt battery, but you would need to change the battery every few hours, which is not at all practice. If you are good with electronics you might be able to rig this some way to actually work outside.",negative,positive
"About 9 months ago, I discovered the sport of Geocaching.  I started out with a Magellan Explorist 200, and was amazed at how well a small device could track your position and find remote locations.<br /><br />Soon I was ready to move up to a more sophisticated GPSr with connectivity to my computer to load the waypoints, etc.  A fellow geocacher recommended the Garmin GPSMap 60CSx as one of the best available - so I ordered one in April 2006.<br /><br />From the start I was not impressed with the tracking stability.  As ""Coaster"" mentions in his review, the display ""walks"" while you are standing still.  Sure, most GPSr's will do this to some extent, but the 60CSx goes nuts.  I upgraded my firmware a couple times, the last time as recently as Dec 2006 - with no improvement.  It does work, but you will get a bit more exercise finding a cache when you are chasing around and around trying to zero in on your target.<br /><br />On the good side, Garmin's customer service is the best around.  Whereas Magellan's customer service could use a lot of improvement.  The mapping software from Garmin is top notch and some of the best.  The battery life in the 60CSx is also top notch!  I can cache for a couple days on the battery life from one set of alkaline AA batteries!  The 60CSx also has just about everything that you could ever want in a portable GPSr!  It even has games!<br /><br />So, why didn't I keep mine?  Simple: the basic functionality.  I need a handheld GPSr to find caches, and I occasionally it use to find an address.  I tried my 60CSx and a Magellan Explorist 500 side by side caching.  I tried it in the open and under a thick, dense canopy of trees.  Both picked up a good signal under these conditions and led me to within 30 feet of the target cache, but the 60CSx started dancing me around the cache - while the Explorist 500 pointed me straight at the cache and was accurate within 4 feet!!  The Explorist was consistent and didn't ""walk"" very much- and was much more stable.  The result was spending a lot less time shrub hunting and more time finding caches.<br /><br />Garmin can brag about the sensitivity of the 60CSx, but Magellan has had the same or better sensitivity for several years.  Garmin just has a much better marketing department - another lesson that Magellan could learn.<br /><br />So before you buy, do the same test that I did.  Borrow a 60CSx and an Explorist model 400, 500, or 600 and see for yourself.",neutral,positive

"TLDR; Definitely do not recommend.<br /><br />This is pretty darned awful, unfortunately. I have a two-monitor pole mount, but the lower monitor was too close to the desk and I ended up remounting it in a different place. I wanted to move my laptop to the lower VESA mount, below my large 4K monitor. The good part of this product is the mounting options for  the metal base are flexible and all the screws you need are included. That’s about the end of the positives. The plastic side braces need to be put together, and they are awkward and difficult to assemble. The adjustments are not so bad, but don’t fit well for laptops in a docking station. But the absolute worst thing is that the way this is built, the metal base is a piece of flat metal with a rounded bend at the rear side. There is absolutely no support for the front of the mount, so a laptop on the tray will bounce like a low rider car on bad hydraulics. Forget about trying to use the keyboard or touchpad because your laptop will be constantly diving away from your hands.<br /><br />I’m trying to decide between sending this back and adding some braces I will have to fabricate. The weird mounting angle places the front edge of my laptop less than two inches above my desktop keyboard, so I think I’m just going to end the misery this product is causing me.",negative,negative
"I ordered a 'Arteck 2.4G Wireless Mouse with Nano USB Receiver Ergonomic Design Silent Clicking' mouse for review.  I have several different brands of wireless mice and I wanted to see how this one compared to more expensive brands.  This mouse is a matte black.  It clicks are not completely silent but, my wife does not hear me use when she is across  the room.  It's ergonomic design fits my hand perfectly and is very comfortable to use.  It moves smoothly and  even without a mouse pad, this mouse moves pretty well.  With the dongle it connected immediately to my Surface and I have no connection issues.  The dongle stores in the bottom of the mouse in an enclosed compartment which helps me to keep track of it when I am not using it.  This mouse is rechargeable., which I prefer to having to use batteries.  The charge lasts several days before I have to recharge it.  Overall, this is a pretty basic mouse but works well for non-gaming tasks.",positive,positive

Have no idea what the HP engineers and marketing people were thinking when they let this go to market. I'm an IT guy and the HP laptop I use for most of my work died. This is the closest replacement I could find. The video is perfect for the HD videio work I do but the sound is the worst I have heard in my life. Sounds like speakers in a tin can. Really really bad! Wiped the drive and installed pure MS Windows 7. Sound was slightly better but still heart breaking for someone who likes music. Second its wireless N... NOT. Limited to 2GHz only with no 5GHz capability. Wireless g on 2GHz = 54Mbps wireless N on 2GHz = 54Mbps. No difference. Other than that this it is a fast great laptop. Come on HP...

"I recently recieved this battery and cover. It takes forever to charge but the card that comes with it says to charge for 12 hrs and to get full capacity it will need to be charged fully 4 to 5 times.  Once it charges to 100% it still continues to charge I am guessing because the s3 is only designed to work with 2200mh.  But as long as the red led is lit up its still charging.  Make sure to use the factory charger or one that supplies at least 1 amp on 5 volts.  I have turned on wifi,gps,sync,mobile data,screen brightness 100 % power saving off and have been looping it on videos along with about 20 background apps running. Been going for 4 hrs and still have 70 % battery left. I havent had it long enough to say wether this will continue or not but so far its looking pretty legit.  The back case is kind of cheap and I can easily see how so many people are having it crack.  Probably should get a bump case with it.<br /><br />Updated after a week of use this battery has proven itself. You can not kill this battery even with heavy use in a normal day with all the goodies turned on. My day starts at 6:30 and ends at 11pm and by the end of the day with multiple email accounts syncing, using bluetooth for podcast, wifi mobile data and sync with twitter dropbox google drive ms exchange , lots of google maps etc still have around 20 % by the end of the day. Very happy with purchase. Sounds corny but everyone saying this battery makes the phone feel better is actually true the added heft is really nice. Battery door has shown no cracks or signs of failing.<br /><br />Update.  Extended case is cracked on lower left hand corner. Phone has not been dropped or abused in any way I baby this phone its my precious..  Battery life is still excellent and easily gets a full day with everything turned on all day and heavy usage.

"Pros:<br />It's cool looking<br />I can play music from every device I have, old or new<br /><br />Cons:<br />It feels a bit flimsy. the electronic device drawer isn't set in tight and wobbles and also pushes in too far so it can stick if you push it in wrong.<br />Sounds isn't great.<br />Dials and buttons are hard to read<br /><br />The first one I received, the drawer on the side was completely broken, laying somewhat inside the body and whatever was broken off was rolling around inside. It was a pain to have to repackage it the way it was sent - box within a box within a box. But I did receive a replacement quickly. If you don't care much about sound quality, then it is fine. However, I didn't think I DID care that much, but when I'm playing the radio, cd, etc... I'm finding that it's leaving me a little disappointed - I know there's more to hear than what I'm hearing.<br /><br />Lesson: you get what you pay for and I think I over paid. :P",neutral,negative
"These are reasonably priced aRGB fans that get the job done if you want your rig to look like a disco attack from the 1970s. That said, be aware that most of them have the center label misaligned so when it spins it looks like the fan is not centered in its casing and that can drive you nuts. Also, they are not quite as quiet and smooth as the NZXT fans that I was trying to replace. I'm also not super happy with the individual fan and RGB controllers included in the package, they were flimsy and a pain to secure to the chassis with the two-sided sticky tape.",neutral,negative

"Many cars on the market come with a rear-view camera that allows for seeing where the vehicle is moving when in reverse. Often the view appears on a dashboard screen. This is handy when parking and maneuvering while the vehicle is backing up. For vehicles that do not have a rear-view camera the alternative is to add on a kit that provides the same functionality. This is my first experience with such a kit and so far I am pleased with it. It does require doing a little work on the vehicle to set it up but the effort is worth it.<br /><br />The package contains everything needed to set up this camera system. In addition to the camera and the screen, the kit includes the mounting screws for the actual camera as well as all of the wiring to connect everything together and to the power (reverse lights). There is also a mini-remote for interacting with the video screen though this is slightly inconvenient.<br /><br />I spent a good deal of time reading and rereading the directions and concluded that the instructions could have been better. There are three pieces of documentation in the box; one shows a generalized set of four different configurations for connecting everything together (the fourth diagram on this sheet matches the configuration you want), one is a photocopied image of a wired system and the third is a “User’s Manual” which is one half-sheet of paper with a brief summarization of the product. There really needs to be a better documentation set than this.<br /><br />If you are not skilled in working with electrical systems, either plan on this taking a good while or have someone you trust install the system. It’s not especially hard to set one of these up, but it does take some patience and a little bit of knowledge of the layout of the car’s wiring. I have worked on car electrical systems in the distant past so I had a vague familiarity, but it still took me a while to have everything set up and working.<br /><br />Once wired the system is fairly straightforward to use. If it is wired up properly (meaning everything is connected to power on both ends and the two main components can see one another) it works nicely. The image when the camera is feeding to the monitor is bright and reasonably clear; the brightness can be adjusted as needed which helps when using this system at night. Another reviewer commented that he used a different camera connected to this system - while I am personally satisfied with the image quality, it’s reassuring to know that you can use another video camera if desired or necessary.<br /><br />The addition of the remote will appeal to some, but for me it’s a component that can easily be lost. The menu system on the monitor provides the same functionality as the remote and this is good enough for me.<br /><br />This is my first experience with rear-view video systems and though it gave me a little trouble setting up it was from lack of good documentation and inexperience, not from being a bad product. Once installed this is a nice and easy-to-use video system. Time will tell how long it works.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",positive,positive

"I just used my Lobers Headphone Earmuffs to take a quick jaunt around the block--its rare that New Orleans gets weather so cold that any earmuffs are required for a simple walk through the neighborhood.  Today the wind was 21mph and the temperature at 34 degrees.  I may have caught a little cold air where my scarf didn't quite cover my neck, but my ears were nice and toasty. So as far as warmth go, these earmuffs get full marks.  Aesthetically, they make a nice presentation: my earphones are red knit with black faux fur on the part of the device that actually protects the ear.  The entire band that wraps around your head is encased in the same red knit fabric.  The connecting wire is black with a garment clip and a switch that allows me to turn the sound on and off.  The plug fits into my iPod and iPhone and the sound initially was loud and crisp.  I have had these earmuffs for at least five years and unfortunately, the connecting wire that goes into the earmuff seems to be a bit loose--I can press it in, but I imagine that the mechanism is fragile and I don't want to break whatever connection is left.  The sound I get is still audible--around a middle sound level when my device is on full blast.  However, for the frequency of time that I use these earmuffs, adequate enough functionally to keep me going for another two or three winters without replacement.<br /><br />Bottom line?  The Lobers Headphone Earmuffs are warm, attractive and have worked for over five years.  Recommended.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />&#34;reneofc&#34;",positive,positive

"I bought one of these for a customer desperate to get a clear broadcast signal in a spotty reception area. Much to my chagrin, the supplied coax cable had a bad end, right out of the box. I was reluctant to repair it, not knowing how the antenna would perform, so before installing in her ceiling I tested with my own coax and results were good enough to take the risk. After replacing the bad end and installing the antenna, I found good results, better than with any of the several other compact antennas I have used previously. I was surprised to discover - quite by accident - that even when the control box is unplugged, the antenna still works. A sure indication that there is not in fact an amplifier built into the antenna. It is fairly directional, which means it exhibits ""gain"", but that's not the same thing as ""amplified"".<br /><br />I have already recommended this product to another customer looking to ""cut the cable"", but with precaution about the bad cable.

It doesn’t seem that the overlap to attach it is long enough. It’s already fallen off a couple of times. It’s snapped on as much as it can be on. I don’t think I’m doing anything wrong unless somebody has some little trick they can help me with.<br /> It is a lot more durable than those flimsy ones that don’t do anything but prevent it from being scratched. It’s not going to matter if it gets scratched if it falls down and breaks right? If this one would snap on better and stay on I would feel a lot more comfortable and give it at least a four star.

This product is exactly what I needed but the ball joint socket doesn't tighten enough when using a tablet. When using something slightly heaver than your phone you really need to tighten this down so it doesn't tilt down on you.

"I suppose it's not enough for Garmin to make billions of dollars from selling GPS units. In order to try to scrape every dime out of you, Garmin posts annoying popup ads on all of its units. This way it can provide traffic instructions and the ad money pays for the traffic instructions. The ads are very annoying and there is no way to get rid of them. Tomtom does not do this. On the Tomtom traffic is provided ad-free- the way it should be.<br /><br />Furthermore, the maps are not crisp at all. It looks like a blurry, low-resolution map with very bad graphics. In a side by side comparison both Tomtom and Magellan had better, sharper maps!<br /><br />To add insult to injury, the unit does not even have the junction view it shows pictures of on its box.  When I called Garmin about this and asked them the rep. said that Garmin had a ""disagreement"" with Navteq- the map provider and will have to make all the junction view maps on its own in the future.  Meanwhile, Garmin still goes ahead and uses false advertising by showing the junction view picture on the box and on Amazon.  It is rahter disturbing!",negative,negative

"[[VIDEOID:2af2adb18c1f06a07336ba3479d674e6]] The telescope used was an AWB One Sky Reflector Dobsonian 5"", made by Celestron. Although I eventually got the imager to bring the moon into focus, I had to adjust the expandable arms of the telescope by shortening their length but the image of the moon was not as bright and sharp as it appears when viewed with an eyepiece. Trying to view the planets also needed the same adjustment to the telescope arms. In fact after succeeding in getting the imager to bring the planets into focus or at least the best focus it was capable of achieving, using the One Sky, I found out viewing the planets were a big disappointment with this imager. They were not as sharp or clear as was visible with an eyepiece and I could not make out any detail whatsoever of Jupiter. Although I could see Jupiter's moons or at least five of them at best, I could not see any bands on Jupiter or color differences, while when viewing with an eyepiece, I can make out bands on Jupiter and see it way brighter and clearer. The problem with this imager is that it does not show you, on the computer screen, what you can see using an eyepiece. What you see is not what you get with this telescope imager. I am very disappointed. The only saving grace is that it works with an Apple MacBook. I have no choice but to return this imaging camera because I don't only need it for the moon, which is all it's good for with the AWB One Star Telescope.",neutral,positive
"Camera works well and raspberry pi picks up easily. Video resolution goes to the promised 1920x1080, however it seems like an upscaled 480 image.

They go on with too early (with light too bright), and the one adjuster that works isn't easy to set.

"[[VIDEOID:4c60e87ead4c44abcba14a2d6daa5b1e]] When I test speakers I play the type of music that is meant for headphones because of the meticulous care taken when mixing the recordings. I don't expect headphone quality, but I do expect balanced sound and on occasion, a little extra ""undistorted"" bass. I do like my bass and the Doss Soundbox Pro+ did not disappoint.  The bass was punchy and clean without being overwhelming.<br />Not only did this fill my living room with clear, undistorted sound, but I could hear it two rooms away without it sounding too bright or boomy at max volume. I am not sure if this would be loud enough to blast through a large room filled with noisy people, but it's perfect for smaller gatherings and apartments that share common walls with neighbors.<br />I mostly use this with my computer, so the even though the lights are fun, they're a bit distracting near my screen, and I was able to turn it off by holding the ""extra bass"" button for a few seconds.

"There’s a lot I like about this MP3 player. I like the fact that the storage is extensible with an SD card. I like that it supports many different file formats. And I like the abundance of features: Bluetooth, voice recorder, and ebook support to name a few.<br /><br />However, I’ve run into a couple of frustrations. First: card memory isn’t treated as an extension of the device memory. Functionally this means that music on my SD card doesn’t show up by default and has to be rescanned every time I turn on the device. Moreover, the albums on the SD card are listed in a random order, which is frustrating when I just want to listen to an album on its own.<br /><br />Verdict: if you need a cheap MP3 player, I recommend this one, but well-curated playlists are a must, and SD card storage is probably better for videos and voice memos than it is for music.",neutral,positive
"Let me start by clarifying that I purchased this exact printer model from Best Buy—I did not purchase it from Amazon. This review pertains to the printer itself and my experience with it, prior to returning it.<br /><br />I run an Etsy shop and have relied on a super solid workhorse All-in-one HP printer for over two years. It had its quirks, but I was able to get excellent quality prints often enough that it was worth the quirk. It recently had an ink-splosion that caused it to no longer run 4 x 6 prints. So I immediately began searching for my next printer.<br /><br />I did extensive research, reading the ins and outs of a massive variety of options. I compared reviews from various brands, models, functionality, print quality, and so on. I even reached out to a few knowledgeable humans regarding ideal printer recommendations for my needs.<br /><br />I went to the store twice before returning for a third time and begrudgingly (yet oddly hopeful) purchased this printer: the HP Envy Photo 7155. That is how dedicated I was to finding the right printer. I took my time. More than enough time, right?<br /><br />Wrong. This printer included frustrating experiences free of charge. Set up was easy, it’s an HP, not rocket science. Everything was pretty straight forward...I liked the option to have multiple types of paper loaded in separate trays. It printed very, VERY quietly. Almost too quietly...<br /><br />The photo quality was an absolute JOKE compared to my old hp all-in-one. The only area that I was impressed with was the quality of the darkest blacks. Everything else was grainy and nothing to write home about—even after adjusting and readjusting settings on both the printer itself as well as my computer.<br /><br />Paper trays were a nightmare. Printer updates were in check. Still: Printer demanded 5x7 photo paper even when it was specifically set for printing 4x6 or 8.5x11. The most infuriating part? It failed to register paper in either tray. Time after time after time. After about the 6th or 7th print job sent and roughly one week into owning the printer, I had counted 8 attempts to help the printer realize it had paper for ONE print. (This includes: pulling trays out, tidying and replacing the already existent paper, pushing paper all the way to the front, resetting brackets, closing drawer, etc.) aaaand that was it. I was done. Printing one SINGLE 4x6 print was taking more time and effort than my sanity could reasonably handle.<br /><br />Overall: I gave this printer a chance after extensive research, and it made me look like an absolute idiot. Worst hp printer I’ve ever purchased and attempted to use in my 30-some years of life on this beautiful planet. The work was not worth the quirk, my friends. I strongly recommend you keep looking.

"I use a messenger bag to carry tools and supplies with me to and from work. I typically have a flashlight, a power bank, batteries and any tools I need for the day in my bag. I had a different bag that I used prior to receiving this bag and I have chosen to use this bag as it is better made and is larger.<br /><br />I have the gray version of this bag and it is an attractive bag, to say the least. Like a typical messenger bag it has a large pouch pocket over which there is a flap that snaps down and keeps everything in place. There is more to this bag than just the basics, though. It is made of heavy canvas and it is very rugged; after carrying it with me for a month it still looks new and unused though it has been packed and repacked daily for weeks. The shoulder strap is heavy canvas too and it is of course adjustable so it is easy to find the right fit for your shoulder. The flap does not actually snap down but instead is held in place with two strong fastening magnets.<br /><br />On the front of this bag are two loose pockets that are perfect for carrying a flashlight, a utility blade or other tools. I have even been able to fit a power bank in there for charging my phone when I have needed to make room in the main compartment. I like these because they do not share space with the main compartment and are separated from it by a layer of canvas. On the back is a zippered pocket that shares space with the main pocket. It’s ok for very small things. The main compartment is large enough to handle a set of screwdrivers, some wrenches, a pack of batteries and more (though adding all that stuff makes the bag understandably heavy). There is a small zippered pocket inside the main compartment that is great for things like AA batteries or other small items. There are also two small open pockets inside that work well for holding smaller items, though by being open they can handle larger things that the zippered pockets.<br /><br />I have been using this bag as a tool bag and it is working out very well for me. I have been pleased with all of the pockets and compartments and I like the fact that this is a heavy-duty bag meant to last a long time. I had another messenger bag that I used for this, but now it’s used just for carrying a tablet and a few minor accessories. This is a high-quality bag at a good price.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",positive,positive

"This has worked pretty well. The setup was easy enough and so far, I've had no major complaints. A few little things:<br />1. The lights are ridiculously bright. This has been said repeatedly, but I'll say it again. I kind of figured people were being a bit picky and hyperbolic...NOPE. The lights actually made watching a movie nearly impossible. I just placed a piece of electrical tape over it, which has worked fine for me. If you place the tape right, you can still see the indicator lights just a bit, but not at full power.<br />2. That being said, some of the indicator lights have already gone out.<br />3. The IR sensor for the remote is not great. I feel like I have to have the two perfectly aligned to get the thing to respond.<br />4. The fourth HDMI input on the front is really annoying. Just makes everything look sloppy.<br /><br />Overally, it has been a nice solution since I didn't want to buy a whole new stereo receiver to get HDMI inputs. I don't understand why new TVs have so few inputs, but this has been a nice solution. It also works well with my Harmony remote.",neutral,positive

"I thought this was going to be made more to carry his firepad securely, but I dont think so.. It is pretty small, but this backpack is super cute. It has an easy zipper, the kind with the large plastic teeth. So it's easy to use and made well. Extra pockets inside.

You really need one anyway--eventually.  Onkyo has ones with 5 to 7 HMDI input ports that aren't very spendy. I have one in use for some time now and it has proven to be very reliable at 1080P.  For some reason the most recent year of Onkyo units have one less port than the year before, but you should be able to find a ""new"" one from the previous year if you need max port count and probably at a lower price also.",neutral,negative

"It's been one sad experience after another with my HP Windows 8 PC................................<br /><br />My PC crashed 3 times before HP replaced its motherboard and reformatted my hard disc.  Then I tried to upgrade to Windows 8.1 after being repaired and it crashed again.  Then I went to check an Emergency Boot DVD and it crashed again..!  I have now spent a total of 12 weeks reloading programs & documents.  That probably represents a thousand hours of mind boggling work.  (By the way, my replacement motherboard wasn't a new one.  I was told that the Repair Facility would backup all my files before formatting my drive.  I guess the BIG NOTE that I stuck to the PC's case reminding them to do such, didn't mean much.)<br /><br />When I recently contacted HP (again), they told me that this Pavilion 500 Series CAN NOT CURRENTLY BE DOWNGRADED TO WINDOWS 7 OR UPGRADED TO WINDOWS 8.1..! THAT DID IT FOR ME....<br /><br />I just purchased a new Dell XPS-8700 Inspiration PC with Windows 7 installed.  Yeah, the Dell cost me $1,000 on top of the $550 that I already spent.  However, life is too short for me to continue trying to tolerate all this asinine system crashing.  The Windows 8 operating system that Lord Billy Gates kids designed for use with their toys, must still contain some unknown glitches that haven't been identified & resolved.<br /><br />Don't think that your experience with Windows 8 is going to be the same as mine.

"I'm on the fence about this Kindle. For the price, I expected more. However, I am not returning this device and will continue to use it.<br /><br />What I like about this device is how ergonomic it is. It is easy to hold in my hand, and the page turning buttons are perfectly placed. I like how thin it is. The design is very sleek and coupled with the leather cover, this Kindle feels very classy. The size is perfect for me, the the lightweightness makes it very easy to bring along in my purse. I got the merlot cover. I've only had it for a month but the edge of the leather cover has started to show signs of wear and tear (I suspect the fraying marks are from my purse).<br /><br />There are some things I'm not too happy about. The screen seems to have a light gradient to it. It's whitish on the button side then slowly turns yellowish to the other side. I thought I got a defective unit but looking at some pictures posted, this seems like a normal thing. Reading in daylight, you can't really see the gradient, however, reading at night you will be able to.<br /><br />Also, I was surprised that the black e-ink wasn't as black as I would like. There are a lot of white spots when an image with all black appears.<br /><br />The battery life seems ok to me, however, I am peeved at the false advertisement of how this device can go months without charging. Even with airplane mode on and not using the device, I highly doubt it would go months. Mine goes about two weeks with 0.5-2 hours of reading a day at 9-12 brightness (on airplane mode, the battery might last longer).<br /><br />Overall, this device looks great but its performance isn't that great. I'm still feeling dismayed about the price for this. For that amount, I expect a better performance, or at the very least, no ads. I am neutral about recommending this device. It's a nice device to buy if you're new to Kindle reading. However, I don't see any sense in trading in your voyage or paperwhite for it.",neutral,positive

"I’m 50/50 on the Blink XT2. It’s a decent system that has non contractual usage, which is very awesome... I just find a couple of issues with the system performance. There are no options for notification updates or changes to the system and the only tone that it will play doesn’t not work all me up at night. Also, you can arm the system on a schedule, which is cool, but again system options are limited. I have cameras that surround my house but, my dogs are always setting off the backyard cams... which happens all day and night. You can’t just arm the front yard cameras for all day use while turning off the rear cameras so the dogs don’t set them off in the day time. This means if you’re armed and home, your phone will go off alllllllllll day, and basically be ineffective for monitoring. We have a pool so all day long I’m also going in and out the house and it just adds to the notifications. I hoped this unit would allow more function in settings but it’s just very basic. There are a couple neat Alexa add one, but I refuse to buy Alexa for several reasons and feel there is a ploy to have to buy Alexa when those features like voice announcements or lights turning on upon motion. I like the system for its purpose, but the function and personalization falls flat on its face and that’s the reason it’s not 5 stars. I’ve read posts and there is AMPLE feedback to Blink/Amazon to correct the notifications (again notification ringer is ineffective unless awake and CANNOT BE CHANGED) but isn’t fixed. I have iphone, heard android users have a little more function??? Yet another uncorrected design flaw.<br /><br />Also, the system crashes from WiFi for no identified reason and requires you to mess with the system. Doesn’t take long but had this a week and happened twice while I’m out and renders the system useless.<br /><br />Another issue is that there is a 10-15 second delay to speak live through the cameras, even with early detection on. Still helpful, but trying to talk to someone through the cameras, like a delivery guy or unexpected guest, creates a lot of awkward conversations through the system.<br /><br />Ideally... it works, and will help, but personalization and lack of settings to help your needs of the system can find a lot of improvement and hope these system flaws are improved as they are completely within the ability to improve function of their designs. Had these issues not been present the system would get 5 stars as the cameras are great, the system is very easy to install and get going, adds piece of mind that you otherwise wouldn’t have with out a high dollar monthly contract. All in all, it’s an improvement to safety, but many things can improve to make it effective and useful. Until then, it’s just bland",neutral,positive
"Got this as an extra thing for a dollar from at&t and I can see why they were basically just trying to get rid of these things, it is extremely slow. Trying to open apps is slow, the reaction to tapping the screen is so slow I sometimes can't tell if it's because I didn't tap the screen hard enough or its just taking that long to react. Updating apps can take hours. I have other devices where there will be 5 or more apps that need to be updated and it will finish in less than a few minutes, but this tablet, just a few apps can take hours to update and install, if it even installs, usually I have to restart the updates multiple times because one of them fails to install probably because it can barely process anything. I keep this tablet around for emergencies and having a larger screen than my phone for digital books. But it's frustrating even using it for that.",negative,negative

"UPDATE:<br />I have had these roughly 2 months now. Wearing them all day at work 8-10ths. I do find myself adjusting them as they sometimes bother my ears but minimal compared to how masks do. I listen to podcasts all day only pausing for breaks or to randomly talk. After a whole day at work playing, they are still about half charged and take maybe 1 hr to recharge fully.<br /><br />Awesome product and extremely pleased with how they work with and without earplugs in!<br /><br />Original:<br />I bought these to use at work. I work in a a very load industry setting (+90 decidable) and using ear buds irritate my ears. Wearing these with ear plugs in I was extremely surprised at how well they still sound. Sound it different with plugs not in but work great so far with podcasts.<br /><br />I wore these all day never taking them off and they are very comfortable. I worried they would bother the tops or backs of my ears like wearing a mask does but didn’t.

Really good shot of the moon, and a barely visible Saturn and its rings. I will say, the iPhone pictures are not as good as what you see when looking through it.<br />My complaints:<br />1)biggest is the tripod mount. It’s fidgety. Like, you look at the moon and don’t really see it moving in the sky, but when you’re trying to put the scope right on it and it takes you more than a minute to do it, it’s already moving out of frame.<br />2) the tripod. It has an accessory shelf to hold lenses, etc.  which is nice, but you can’t collapse the tripod without taking the shelf off, which means putting the two lenses and iPhone mount somewhere else… if you’re setting up in a field for a couple hours, it’s fine. But an idiot like me? Running around my house to different rooms and gazing out the windows?

Background: I have several of the thin rectangular antennas that are commonly sold on Amazon. These cost just under $20. I bought this particular antenna because I saw the word “upgraded” and the advertised far range and I figured the higher price would mean that it would pick up more channels. I did a head-to-head comparison versus the $20 version and it actually performed worse. I ended up returning it Because the extra cost did not justify the worst performance that I was getting with my existing antennas.,negative,positive

"Oh My! Vibrant, crisp picture! Typically only uses 80 watts. Sound is crisp and clear. The TV itself, as a TV, is great. No complaints. It is a very good Samsung product.<br /><br />BUT!!<br /><br />The SMART function is limited, but it does work somewhat. The 'comes with' apps are plentiful, and less than useful for me simply because I live in Canada, so my Amazon Prime movies (an important factor in buying this TV) are ""NOT AVAILABLE IN YOUR COUNTRY!"" Most of the functions that are supposed to work with one's computer, do not work! Why?? Because I did not pay substantially more for the next better model!! It is quite difficult to determine this limiting factor from reading the item description. ""Not available for your model"" is a pretty common message on the screen when trying 'SMART' things. It is possible to use it for surfing, but with the remote being the only controller, it is beyond awkward. If this were a simple small tv with a box that requires only one person to manage, I would have returned it.

"So I’ve bought the magicbuds and I absolutely loved them. My first pair i lost and my second pair I ordered both each under $20. My second pair recently got ran over by the mail person (not on purpose of course) thus prompting me to get another pair. Now that I have just bought the newer version of the headphones there are some noticeable difference between the two of them. It is mainly the size of the headphones themselves. The headphones are like half an inch thicker then the originals, they still sound amazing and when you turn up and down the volume there is no annoying beeping sound when you get all the way down to no sound. The clips the go around your ears are way stiffer so there less chance of your headphones coming out of your ears and it’s still pretty comfortable. I’ve used these headphone at work for about 8hrs and it’s still going. The blue light on the first ones don’t blink as much of as harshly when the Bluetooth is in use. Though there are good changes I don’t think it was worth the $4 mark up, other then the stiffer clip, slightly longer battery life, and thicker headphones that I didn’t particularly like I don’t see much more of a difference. The noise cancellation just like the first one is amazing and the plugs that also go in your ear are a lot stiffer which don’t make it very comfortable.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />The clip for the ears loosened up and they don’t hold on to my ears at all. These headphone are horrible compared to the original. I’m just going to return them",negative,positive

"I have helped install 2 of these Q-see systems. They use Ethernet to connect the cameras to the recording device, which is called an NVR (Network Video Recorder). I have had problems with both systems because of networking issues to the remote cameras. The system works decent once correctly networked (and if your network is robust), but in my opinion it took way to much work to get them installed reliably. I was also shocked at how little the Q-see support staff knew about Ethernet protocols. I much prefer conventionally wired systems with HD resolution for their simplicity and high performance.<br /><br />To try and simplify a complicated and confusing topic, almost all DVR's and NVR's can connect to Ethernet (which is the network that the Internet/World Wide Web/Web run on). This feature allows you to view the cameras on your cell phone or remote computer. I call this the back end. The front end of the DVR or NVR is where the cameras attach. With DVR's the wires between the cameras and DVR front end are direct connected via cables with a very simple point to point connection.<br /><br />NVR's on the other hand use Ethernet on the front end to attach the cameras. This means the cameras are networked individually, and can be viewed individually without the NVR. While this has huge advantages in a large facility with dozens of cameras at long distances, in my opinion it is overly complicated for a average home or smaller retail shop with little networking knowledge. If you don't know how to configure a router and firewall, and don't understand IP addressing or have a friend that does, stick with the DVR systems.<br /><br />Below I have written up some non-brand specific tips that I hope you find helpful in your quest... Happy Shopping!<br /><br />Surveillance Camera Systems<br /><br />The following is my security camera experiences in our 2500 sqft. retail shop.<br /><br />So you want a good camera surveillance system, but can't afford the high prices that professional installers charge? Let me give you some details so you don't make the same mistakes we did over our 2.5 year experiment. Had we known these tid-bits in the beginning it would have saved us a lot of time and money. At first we thought that buying a camera surveillance system would be a piece of cake; just buy one of the many cheap boxed systems and install it. Turns out that was wishful thinking! But in the end we built a high performance system that any ""do it yourselfer"" can install and maintain, and for much less than professionally installed systems.<br /><br />Most importantly, remember this; police and courts need clear detailed pictures or videos to identify criminals and defend against frivolous lawsuits! If your system can't do that, it is a waste of money!<br /><br />1) What video security systems am I writing about?<br />The systems discussed here consist of a Security DVR, Cameras, and the cable to connect them. (I have also included a few notes on NVR's)<br /><br />2) What is a DVR?<br />A DVR (Digital Video Recorder. Also called a NVR if the cameras are attached via a Ethernet network) is basically a small single purpose computer that stores your surveillance videos on a internal hard drive. Most all have a connector to plug in a standard computer display or HD TV for viewing your videos. Some retail boxed systems actually look like a monitor, but have all the computer parts and disk drive built inside and are very compact.<br /><br />Note: There are also DVR ""cards"" that can be installed in a desktop PC computer. They are more expensive, and require hours of monkey-ing with computer hardware and software. Unfortunately, the reliability of PC DVR's is based on your computer knowledge and skill. Leave it to the pros.<br /><br />3) What about these DVR Surveillance Camera Systems in a box I see for sale at electronic stores?<br />We purchased several lower cost retail boxed systems (and seriously 15+ different cameras and recorders). They all had such mediocre grainy video, we returned them all! Digital zooming to see more detail with lower resolution systems creates an unacceptable grainy image. You need as high a resolution system as you can afford so digital zoom can produce clear videos and snapshots. We learned this the hard way when a burglar was caught on video with our first analog 420TVL system. When we tried to zoom in to get a good image of his face, it was too grainy to recognize. Even our last analog 660TVL system did a ""just barely acceptable"" job in my opinion. Although it did help police convict the burglars in our third and last break-in, the zoomed videos and pics were grainy at best.<br /><br />4) Ok then, what is a good system with decent video for zooming?<br />The cheapest way to get ok zoomed images are with 600TVL to 700TVL analog cameras and DVR's (surprisingly, these are called high resolution, a hold-over from days past). But for really useful quality video, I highly recommend the newer ""Digital HD"" (high definition) 720p cameras and DVR's, or the top of the line 1080p models. While a 660TVL analog system is only about 1/3 of a megapixel, the new digital HD systems deliver an astounding 1 megapixel video for 720p models and 2 megapixels video for 1080p. This is substantially better for digital zooming so you can view details, like a criminals face. HD has been around in TV's for years... not sure why the retail security market has been so far behind. But it is finally here.<br /><br />5) What about these convenient wireless systems I see at electronic stores?<br />None of the reasonably priced `wireless' systems we tried worked acceptably.<br />We tried three, and after our own experience and researching opinions online, is seems none of the lower cost wireless systems available in 2011-2012 work satisfactorily. And unfortunately with wireless, your video can be viewed or jammed with a transceiver available to anyone. Reasonably priced secure wireless security cameras are still a dream.<br /><br />6) What about these PTZ cameras I see for sale?<br />PTZ (Pan/Tilt/Zoom) are remotely steerable and optically zoomable cameras. Unfortunately someone has to be at the controls 24/7 to steer them. And wow, the good ones are super expensive! Leave them to the mall and casino security teams. Besides, one wide angle HD camera can usually take a PTZ's place if positioned correctly, though admittedly with less zoom capability.<br /><br />7) Can I take a boxed Surveillance Camera System home and install it quickly?<br />Camera positioning takes a lot of thought! Don't just slap them up, think about what the cops will need to see. When we got broken into the second time, we couldn't see the guy's face on video because of a baseball cap. We then remounted some cameras lower. Surprisingly, floor mounting some cameras gave us the best video coverage. Also, different cameras are available in normal, wide angle or telephoto models for special video coverage needs. We have a floor mounted telephoto pointing at the front door to catch facial detail, another window mounted telephoto to see license plates in the parking lot, and four ceiling mounted wide angles to see shoplifting activity. Because our suite has two rooms, one of which is non-square and full of camera blocking racks, I wish we had more cameras...<br /><br />8) How many cameras should my DVR handle?<br />For a small retail store, buy a 600TVL to 700TVL analog high resolution or preferably a HD Security DVR, that can handle 8+ cameras! If budgeting, buy a few cameras now, and then add additional cameras later as your budget allows. Over time you will ALWAYS want more cameras. A 4 or 6 camera DVR will need to be completely replaced (more $$$) if you want more than 4 or 6 cameras in the future!<br /><br />9) How much is this going to cost me?<br />In mid 2012, a decent quality 8 camera analog 600TVL to 700TVL analog high resolution system costs between $1500 and $2200, and a HD system between $2400 and $3000. You can cut the cost of entry by buying a 8 camera capable DVR and a few cameras now, then adding more cameras later as you can afford them. Many sites are predicting that HD will displace analog as quickly as it did in TV's, but who knows? I just know that buying old technology never works out for me. Bottom line: We found out the costly and time consuming way that less expensive systems were inadequate for protecting our assets and defend against frivolous lawsuits.<br /><br />10) What about LED day/night cameras?<br />Rule of thumb: day/night IR (Infra-Red ... IR light is invisible) LED cameras work fine, but only up to about 2/3's the advertised illumination range. No matter what brand we tried they came up short. So buy cameras with an IR range that is about 1/3 more than you need. Also, don't go crazy with the IR range either. We tried a day/night camera with a 50 foot range in a small room, and the picture was greatly overexposed. Note: All day/night cameras with LED's produce black and white pictures when it is dark. That's ok, as long as it's high resolution or preferably HD.<br /><br />11) Are there cameras that can see in near darkness without IR LED's?<br />Yes. They are called low lux cameras. Good ones are expensive and need at least a slight amount of well positioned light to work satisfactorily. The two we tried worked, but if the small amount of available lighting was coming from behind or above (moonlight), all we saw was a silhouette of the criminal. IR LED cameras work easier and are better to identify night time crooks for us.<br /><br />12) What about power for the camera(s)?<br />Two options: You either need a power outlet near every camera, or power the cameras with siamese type video/power cable. Siamese video/power cable carries video AND power to the cameras from the DVR location, so the cameras don't need a power outlet locally. This is important to get the optimum camera viewing angles needed. Remember that the cable isn't cheap, so budget it in. This same remote power option is available also with Ethernet NVR systems, and is called POE (Power Over Ethernet).<br /><br />13) Have you watched some security videos on the news, and noticed they were jumpy. Why?<br />It is simplest to explain video the same as film, as actually pictures (frames) that are swapped at a fast rate. 24 to 30fps (frames per second, also sometimes called ips or images per second) is similar to what your TV and theater movies display. This is visually pleasing, but consumes too much disk space for 24 hour security camera videos. DVR's allow you to select the fps, thereby reducing the video storage disk space needed. For our use, 7.5fps missed some action and blurred fast moving people/objects and therefore was unacceptable. 15fps (frames per second) is a good compromise for us, giving fairly smooth more natural looking movement on our videos without eating up too much disk storage space.<br /><br />14) What other limitations do DVR's have besides total number of camera's?<br />DVR's have a limit of how many total fps they can process at one time from all cameras.<br />Example: If the DVR is rated at 60fps total, and has 8 camera ports, the available fps per camera is 7.5fps (60 / 8 = 7.5), too few in my opinion. I would opt for an 8 camera DVR with 120 total fps (15fps per camera), or a 16 camera DVR with 240 total fps (again, 15fps per camera). Both of these would allow each camera 15fps for video capture. (Note that some manufacturers refer to fps as ips.)<br /><br />So my final recommendation for the small business owner is spend your hard earned money on a 8 or 16 camera (also called channels or ports) HD 720p DVR system (or a HD 1080p 8 or 16 camera if you've got the budget). They are relatively easy to install and operate even for smart non-techies. With proper camera positioning, these will give you great video with good digital zoom to nail the criminals.",neutral,positive
"Perhaps I received a faulty device, and perhaps I put my RAID storage hopes in a cheap option to be expected to fail. That said, I put 3 - 1TB's WD Black HD's in this and yes, I striped them, however in other good enclosures - I have had no issues striping drives. That said this enclosure never worked, overheated (even on constant high fan settings), and most importantly kept ""eating"" ever HD I put in this thing...<br /><br />The first 3 (would be) solid performing and brand new HD's failed almost instantly -- chalking it up to the HDD's being striped I through in a few more drives as independent drives - well, they all also quickly failed... independently.<br /><br />I was too stupid to realize this enclosure was killing HD's like it's no ones business and put 2 more great 1 TB HD's in and mirrored them... Well again within less than a month - this HD eating monster destroyed those as well. I partially blame myself for hoping this cheap enclosure would be solid and more so - giving it so many chances to ""eat"" my more expensive HD's but either way - lesson learned... This enclosure sucks.",negative,positive
"I've been living with Alexa since the start of 2017, and it's been a mixed bag.  My background: electrical engineer, working with computers since late 70's in hardware and software design.  Expert.

"This is the second Tempered Glass screen protector I have purchased, the first one was from OMOTON for my new Fire HD 8 and it fit perfectly and went on in seconds and was no problem at all because it was cut perfectly for the tablet meaning that it fit perfectly inside the outer edge all the way around the screen.<br /><br />This tempered glass screen protector didn't work out the same way.  Although it is cut to fit the screen of the fire 7 (2015 edition), it's not a perfect fit, meaning that it doesn't fit inside the outer edge all the way around the screen.  In fact, it's smaller than the screen by a few millimeters in each dimension, which doesn't sound like much until you're trying to get the thing centered and all of the corners to adhere.  It took at least eight tries before I got most of the corner to stick and no bubbles.  There was one corner that didn't stick by itself and that usually means that the screen protector isn't aligned right, but since you have to align it by eye instead of it fitting perfectly there's not a lot you can do about that!<br /><br />Luckily for me I was putting this tablet inside a silicone case that would not only cover and hide the corners and sides, but would also hold them in place.  That is the only saving grace here, that another purchase saved the day.  The only reason that I didn't purchase a screen protector for this tablet from OMOTON is that they don't sell one this size.",neutral,positive

The latest firmware updated and caused network disconnects and stability issues lost/dropped connections and many network errors!  The hardware is great its Netgear firmware/software that causes the router to fail and become unusable dropping connections , failed dns etc. making the router useless.  Because the router was refurbished the warranty was up or I would have returned to Netgear and gone with a different vendor. Eventually after many hours on Netgear support forums trying several solutions not liking the end result I finally gave up and went with an alternate solution DD-WRT.  I finally got the router setup with the latest DD-WRT firmware and got a stable network back. I expected some quirks going with an open source firmware and very little support so it was a trial and error for a period, I dont recommend using free opensource firmware if your not familiar with it.  Avoid buying Netgear or any other until you've done your research, check the vendor support forums for known issues and solutions or you could end up with a paperweight. Its a shame Netgear has so many known issues with the firmware of many devices that I have moved away from being that loyal customer but like many vendors they have gone through there share of changes and its now time to move own.",neutral,positive

"Build quality is marginal. Amazing package for the price. It does everything but spit nickels. 1999 Jeep Wrangler. I replaced the original cassette radio years ago with a Pioneer 1 1/2 DIN plug and play radio. I did have to run my own direct to ground wire, so it wasn't all plug and play. I used the same direct to ground wire I ran for the Pioneer for the Schosce/Metra wiring harness. I cut the black ground wire and connected it to the direct to ground. Of course you have to wire the unit to an after market wiring harness manually matching the colors and functions, which wasn't hard, just tedious. You'll also need wire connectors and a pinching tool. I also used electrical tape to secure it all together before final installation. There is a third plug I didn't use for the Jeep that is used for other Chrysler products and the ground must be picked up there and from where I cut the black to connect. Since it's a single DIN chassis, I got a Metra single DIN plastic kit. Everything worked until I re-installed the dash cowling and found the unit's size overcame the top of the cowling. It is 1 1/2 DIN face plate. If it was centered it would work. It's too high in the chassis but not by much. A more center centered plastic adapter would work. The Metra has a bottom slot which makes it taller. I slid the unit out of the chassis a bit and it clicked into place. I'm using it that way (3mm slid out of the mount) and am happy with all the features I picked up. It's an amazing electronic unit. The snap on and off faceplate seems less than robust with plastic gears so I wouldn't expect it to take much ham fisting.

Do buy the Nimh batteries, the supplied alkalines only ran me less than 60 shots, a second set I had along ran over 300 and my power usage wasn't really power wasteful on the first set. The Nimh batteries ought to do you better- I hope.<br /><br />As suggested by the manual I did practice around with the thing and got things going well enough (note: nowhere does Canon bother to tell you that the internal clock is 24 hr, not 12- I got some shots miss dated because of that- 1 pm is 13:00, not 1:00 and so on before I realized how things should be set and that there is no 12 hr setting). I generally shot my pictures in Program mode although some bright/ or overcast shots seemed to do better in Automatic- didn't really bother with most other settings. I tried the folder setting, not sure yet if I have it right, the movie setting does work well (I kept it at top resolution) but the built in microphone is useless for good sound whether you're in the windy outdoors or a relatively quite church (I did both), the built in speaker is even more of a joke. Playback on a TV or PC looks good, my current Pc is too old to meet the specs but my brother's year old laptop recognized the camera without his having to load the software. I used the close up settings (a tulip and MF) several times, tulip was good but I could never get much done with MF. The manuals don't really explain either of the icons but I did get along with tulip, my brother's Canon has a ribbed wheel to turn for MF focusing- just a crummy little lever without much control for this camera, it never would stop just where I wanted it to.<br /><br />I do like the flip over monitor, even though cleaning instructions aren't given that I could find, image stabilization would be nice- I deleted several shots that could've been saved if the A630 had that.<br /><br />I don't really regret buying the thing but Canon needs to improve a few things before I'd be really happy about my camera.",neutral,positive

"For almost one year it was the best TV in the world.<br /><br />Shortly before the warranty expired it developed ""grid lines"" on the right 1/3 portion of the screen. At first it was hardly noticeable and when it became clear there was a real problem the warranty had expired.<br /><br />We tolerated the grid lines and tried to ignore them as much as possible. Some times it was easy depending on what colors and images were on the screen, other times it was aggravating. By the end of only the second year there was large swaths of orange and yellow colored bands overlaying everything including the menu screen. This is when I looked into getting it repaired.<br /><br />Samsung was unwilling to work anything out even though it was only a few weeks past the one-year warranty expiration date.<br /><br />I went online to Samsung to locate a repair center.<br />We live in an area where the closest authorized service center is hundreds of miles away.<br />This TV has since dropped in price by more than half than when we first purchased it.<br />I looked into replacing the motherboard, which can be bought for less than one hundred ninety bucks -but one must feel confident and have some basic skills, and if that isn't the problem fixer, then you have blown your money.<br /><br />I am a certified PC Technician and will attempt to repair it someday, but if one were to take it to a local unauthorized repair shop, they would charge you almost three hundred (maybe more) to fix it. Is it worth it? The jury is still out.<br /><br />My girlfriend watches high-action sports and movies. She bought an LG 50"" plasma television and couldn't be happier. No blur whatsoever. 6000Hz refresh rate (yes, that's SIX-THOUSAND Hertz)3 Million black contrast depth, no screen burn, long life.<br /><br />We paid sixteen hundred bucks for the Samsung 46"" LN model when this first came out and for that amount of money you should get more out of it than just one year of service. In the ""old days"" appliances would last 15-30 years. We would have been happy with five years.<br /><br />It was the best LCD I have seen when it worked correctly, but due to short lifespan and poor customer service policies, I would be apprehensive about buying any Samsung products in the future.<br /><br />Because of this experience, if I found a similar product in the same price range, I would most likely buy it in fear of repeating the same problem/mistake again.<br /><br />I hope Samsung reads this review.",negative,positive

They wanted to charge me as much as i piad for the camera to have it fixed.  They sent it back unfixed.  I vowed never to buy another coolpix...sorry but a camera should not break if it falls onto a carpet one time.  I bought a lumix to replace it.  the lumix by panasonic was less money and guess what..i dropped that in a 2 foot pool of water ... and it recovered and is working again.

"If you’re new to TiVo, be prepared to study the 119 page manual carefully.  Either that or have a 12 year old handy to walk you through it.

It took me a while but I finally found the manual specific to this model and keep it handy because after almost 2 weeks we still referance the manual to figure out how to do something.

"The BESTEK Portable Travel Voltage Converter worked well for me on a recent trip to China.  At one point, I had an iPhone, a Kindle, and a set of headphones plugged into USB outlets while another cellphone and a laptop computer were charging through the 110 V outlets.

The pitch of this buzzing sound does not change with the electrical load.<br /><br />Not knowing which plug I might need, I had left the unit packed in the box in which it arrived.  After unpacking and packing it back through three hotels in China and Hong Kong, I decided to keep using the box as a handy and compact way to keep all the parts (converter box, cord, and three plugs) together in my carry on bag.<br /><br />After reading several of the one-star reviews, it seemed that someone needed to write that this item is NOT designed to handle the electrical demands of most small appliances that have heating elements (like hair dryers, curling irons, hair straighteners, etc.).

"I coupled this card with an  MSI P6N SLI Platinum Motherboard and it works flawlessly.  I also have it hooked up to a 19"" Viewsonic LCD via DVI cable.  Running the LCD at native resolution and have had no problems with any graphics or games thus far.<br /><br />I just noticed that the fan on this card is the loudest one in my case.  It's louder than my two Cooler Master case fans (120mm and 80mm) and the  Cooler Master RR-LCH-P9E1 92mm UFO CPU fan.  In fact, without the video card fan my PC is nearly silent in my home office setting.  With this video card installed, I can hear noticeable fan noise.  Not horrible, just noticeable.  So, if you are building an HTPC, I would suggest getting a fanless card.<br /><br />Throws a bit of heat out of the top of the card (where the fan exhaust port for the card is).  More heat than my  EVGA 256-A8-N313-LX GeForce FX5500 256MB AGP card.  So, if you have a case that doesn't have a grill or screen on the side of the case (where the PCI cards go) then you may want to make sure that you have adequate fans / ventilation to get rid of the added heat to your case.<br /><br />There is no PCI 6-pin connector on this card, so you end up utilizing the mobo power.<br /><br />*****You must make sure that your power supply puts out +12V @ 18A, for this is the minimum power requirement for this card.  Anything below that may not work or show instability.<br /><br />Great card; I highly recommend it.",positive,positive

"The Good:<br />+ Nice Appearance<br /><br />The Bad:<br />- Sparse Instructions<br />- Poor Fit with Charger<br />- Unintuitive Bluetooth Pairing<br />- Short Watch Battery Life<br />- Android App Drains Phone Battery<br />- No App Store for Watch<br />- Inaccurate Step Count<br /><br />Overall:  The S1 watch from Bit comes up short in almost every way imaginable.  Beyond good looks, there isn't much to like in this smart watch.<br /><br />Setup:  Intuition said the first thing to do was assemble the charger and get the battery fully charged.  Even this was not easy because the watch fits very tightly into the proprietary charger.  The booklet said it takes up to two hours, and this was about right.  However, my experience only got worse from here.  The booklet tells you to download the app and pair the S1 with your phone.  I did so on my Samsung Galaxy S7, but the S7 didn't find the S1 when I searched for devices.  The booklet doesn't tell you how to turn on Bluetooth on the S1.  I was able to figure it out, but some users may be stumped at this point.  I knew from using both a Pebble Steel and Samsung Gear Fit 2 that I needed to limit the notifications.  To my disappointment, *all* notifications are enabled by default.  Not only do they have apps listed, but also Android libraries too!  It was annoying getting everything trimmed down.  When I had everything setup, it was time for bed.<br /><br />Usage:  I only used the touch screen enough to explore the apps that come with the watch and make a few comparisons to the step counts between the S1 and my Gear Fit 2 (that I've been using for a year).  I only received 1 text message and no phone calls, and the battery was gone by 2 p.m.  I had email/Gmail notifications turned off.  I only had about half a dozen notifications, but the battery went fast.  My Gear Fit 2, by comparison, is at 77% at 9 p.m. the same day.  The S1 had about 1,300 additional steps registered compared to my Gear Fit 2 (5,500 vs. 4,200).  What's worse, my phone battery was also drained with the battery app listing Fundo Wear (the S1 app) as the top battery consumer.<br /><br />The apps that come with the S1 are nothing special either.  The calendar is nothing more than a &#34;wall calendar&#34;.  It does not sync with your phone's calendar, nor does offer an agenda view of your day.  If that isn't bad enough, there's no app store or any hope of expansion.  I went to the manufacturer's website, but there was no indication of anything beyond what comes with the watch.<br /><br />Conclusion:  There's just not much to like with the Bit S1 watch.  It seems like a poor facsimile of a Pebble.  Limited apps and poor overall performance.  I recommend that you check out something from the Pebble line instead or perhaps something that matches your phone OS better.",negative,negative

"I have Moca 1.0 (Actiontec ECB 2500c,  WCB3000N) mixed with MOCA 2.0 Actiontec ECB6200s and was getting a solid 80-90 Mbits in general and 250-300 Mbits between the MOCA 2.0 adapters.  I ordered the goCoax to get MoCA 2.5 and maybe get more speed out of my cable runs in my house.  I only ordered one goCoax with a plan to order a 2nd (which I've done) if it worked out well.<br /><br />The goCoax worked fine and got my other adapters to the high end of their range (so from 80-90 Mbits to now 100-120 Mbits with the MoCA 1.0).<br /><br />But one connection had an issue that turned out to effect the Moca 2.0 and Moca 2.5 adapters.  From the PC with the Moca 2+ adapter I would get good upload speed (250 Mbits) but my download speed was awful, jumping around in the 0-15 Mbits range.<br /><br />Long story short, I manually adjusted all the adapters' frequency/channel selection up to D6 (1400) and the issue went away.  The Moca 1.0 adapters did not have a problem at what was D3 (1250) and got a rock solid 80-90 Mbits, but the Moca 2+ adapters degraded to single digits in one direction when using D3(1250).<br /><br />Note that this was only on certain cable connections (in our family room in this case) as the 2.0+ adapters worked fine in other rooms (bedrooms, etc.).  Changing MoCA channels was not as simple as changing router wifi channels for example but once done everything began to work as expected, in all directions.<br /><br />Update 4/30/2020:  Bought a 2nd goCoax directly from the company since Amazon was out of stock.  Long story short, the goCoax makes a reasonable MoCA 2.0 device when connecting to Actiontec MoCA 2.0 (or 1.x) devices.  When I directly attached my two goCoax to each other (coax cable, no splitters) I get the same speed I got with the  Actiontec 2.0s between each other and with the goCoax (about 300Mbps).  When the two goCoax are anywhere else but directly attached to each other, they work fine with the Actiontec 2.0s (and 1.xs) but they fail when talking to each other (erratic speed from 0 to under 10 Mbps).  I tried various channels (up to 1600) at various points of coax connections with no other devices connected. Same results.  The MoCA 1.x give me a rock solid 50-80 Mbps, the goCoax simply can't effectively pass data.  I can't tell if one is bad as they both work consistently with the other adapters, just not with each other.  I've sent goCoax support the details and have not heard anything back yet.  As I can only use one at a time on my network, I downgraded the rating to 1.<br /><br />Update 5/6/2020: As an experiment I limited the MoCA Setup scan to D-High and reset the two goCoax.  They settled on Beacon 1500, Primary 1500, Secondary 1375, First Channel 0, Number of Channels 0.  The now get consistent speed (800+ Mbps) with the Actiontecs MoCA 2.0s and with each other.  It seems that when the goCoax tries to work at 2.5 (e.g. Number of channels: 5) they don't work with each other, at least on my network.  So the goCoax works fine as a MoCA 2.0 device but not when trying to do 2.5.  I upgraded the rating to 3 stars as they work well enough and I do prefer their manageability (built in web site for monitoring and configuration) over the Actiontecs.",neutral,negative

"I prefer Fujifilm Acros over every other B&W film on the market. I like it better than both Ilford's and Kodak's offerings. The blacks are deep, the whites are crisp, the tonality of everything in between is gorgeous, and the sharpness and detail is extremely high. It's contrasty but not overly so. Just enough to give it a little punch. The sample photos that I have attached of the NYS Education Building in Albany, NY really show off what this gorgeous film is capable of. The beautiful tonality, sharpness and detail, and low grain are apparent by looking at this building and its extremely detailed exterior.<br /><br /> I was pretty bummed when this was discontinued last year but I am overjoyed that they have put it back into production starting Fall 2019.

Time will tell if the extra memory is going to eliminate the slow speed issue the computer was having, so far it sounds like it did.<br /><br />I am increasing my rating to 5 starts. By the way, Amazon's responsiveness to order's issue was superb.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------<br />One memory was Crucial 8GB but the other one in the kit was not and it was only 4GB (see photo).<br />I've initiated a return. For the moment I can't give it more than 2 stars.",positive,positive

"The finger grips on the lens caps are quite slick, which means that my fingers slip off the grips when trying to attach or remove the cap.  It takes many attempts to get the cap to stay in place, which means that the filter gets scratched by the lens cap.<br /><br />Also, the elastic on the keepers is too large for my lenses.  Of course, it might fit a fatter lens — but then the 46mm lens cap would not fit!  The size of the elastic loop either needs to be adjustable, or the loops needs to be of a size compatible with the size of the lens cap.",negative,positive

"If you like deep throbbing bass that shakes your bones, these are the headphones for you.  I bought them as a gift for my husband because he has hearing issues (from playing drums with no ear protection).  I thought that the customized sound would be good but I’m not really sure if there is a difference.  He is happy with them though.  I took the hearing test and tried them with and without the customized sound and didn’t notice much of a difference.  However, I do not have hearing issues and my left and right hearing was pretty even so I may not be the best judge for that.  The sound is nice, clear and crisp top notes and the bass is easily adjustable from mellow to bone rattling.  I still prefer my Bose quietcomfort but these are definitely just as good and maybe better if you enjoy super heavy bass.  One complaint I have about them is you can only connect them to one device.  To sync to another device you have to manually disconnect from the first device and then connect to the second device.  I have Skullcandy earbuds and they do the same.  My Bose and my Beats Flex do this automatically so I know it’s possible.",positive,positive
I thought these would be great for charging my phone in my pocket or on the go. The cable is so short that you really can only use it when you set your phone and charger down and don’t touch it.

"Just after the printer arrived, I received an email explaining that this model of printer was new to the US, and that I would need to set the voltage on the power supply in the base from 230V to 110V.  Since I had already assembled, tested and discovered this myself, I wrote it off as 'not ready for the US Market'.  There are some pros and cons with this delta, however;<br />Pros:<br />1) LARGE print capacity - my model will print 300+mm high models,<br />2) FAST - compared to my i3 cartesian printers, this thing FLIES,<br />3) 32-bit controller and touchscreen - once you figure out the menus, its pretty convenient, although the STOP function is 3 menus deep,<br />4) Auto-bed leveling (sort of) - It uses a probe which is attached to the tool head by a magnet, but you still have to do the 'paper test' and do a 'Z-offset' adjustment, and this is trial-and-error,<br />5) Dimensional Accuracy (for square parts) - my XYZ test cube was SPOT-ON at 20mm EXACTLY in each dimension!  Shocker, especially from a delta, but there was substantial ringing and overshoot on the corners.<br />Cons:<br />1) Part Cooling (see photo) - there is a fair amount of 'chicken skin' on the surface of prints (see photo).  I was advised to slow the prints down to fix this issue by tech support - WRONG ANSWER.  The printer should print A-OK with default settings with their software,<br />2) NOISE - this thing is LOUD - the controller is an MKS Robin MINI with older stepper drivers.  Since the firmware is proprietary, it is unlikely that they can be upgraded, even though they're in sockets,<br />3) Belt Tension Will Not Stay Tight - This led to some strange issues, like making round objects oval.  The black vase-mode container in the photo is an example; the 2 halves are supposed to thread together,. but they do not.<br />4) Bed Adhesion - if you follow FLSUN's instructions for adjusting Z-offset, your parts will NOT come off the bed!  Either too much stick or horrible elephant foot - don't know if bed temp is correct,<br />5) No filament run-out sensor - easy add-on and the controller would support it,<br />6) Under-extrusion with the 'Titan' extruder - the bowden tube is long and curly (hey, its a delta) but there's a lot of filament grinding going on,<br />7) OLD versions of Cura and Repetier host - since the config file is in Chinese, I cannot tune the extrusion settings to fix (6) and its Gcode vocabulary is lacking.  Seems to work OK with Cura 4.6 and the QQ-S profile,<br />8) Wifi - don't know, the docs are weak on this one, and the language barrier prevents me from using it,<br />9) Rickety platform - the frame sways and wobbles A LOT during printing, which makes it even noisier.<br /><br />In summary, this printer has lots of potential, and I'm getting it dialed in - slowly - and I'm hopeful that the part cooling can be fixed with some better fan shrouds on the tool head.  Some sort of locking nuts instead of thumbscrews for the belt tensioners would be an improvement.  Open source firmware (or at least a link to a Github repository) would help build a community of support for this printer.  The product just needs to be finished up, details polished, and better docs, to really make it a reliable unit for making stuff that works.<br /><br />UPDATE 19-Dec-2020: I have been using this printer to make gifts for the holidays, and one of the belts failed dramatically (see 'Con' item 3 above regarding tension - yeah, a belt let go and stretched 3 inches).  I reached out to FLSUN for help, and they sent parts.  I haven't received those yet, and time was an issue with the holidays fast approaching, but I found 5m 2GT belt stock here on Amazon, watched a YouTube video on how to replace/size them and PRESTO!  Back in business!  The 'chicken skin' issue is much better, and the overall print quality with the new belts (I changed out all 3) is much improved.  I would give the printer 4 stars now based on its current performance, but I'd take away one for the premature belt failure.  My messages to FLSUN regarding the belt support were answered very quickly, so thanks to FLSUN for that.  Happy Holidays!",neutral,positive
"I JUST got this cable today, so I can't really speak to the durability—but it looks/feels durable.<br /><br />It is just... not 6 feet. Based on the fact that I am 5' 7.5"" tall, I would guess this cable is precisely 5' 7.5"" long.<br /><br />I get that a 4.5"" difference may not seem huge, but when you're getting a cable to fit a certain size space, being shorted kinda sucks a bit.<br /><br />I'll keep the cable, because it seems like it's a quality cable—but definitely going to need to order a new/different one to get that extra 4.5"" back.",neutral,positive
"I bought this TV 3/2018, paid a small fortune for it (1300.) and the picture is gone and I call the local LG service guy in Huntingdon tn and he wants me to carry in a 75 inch tv in to him or pay him 100. Each way for him to pick it up. Carrying this tv anywhere makes me worry about the 100 ways it could get broken along the way and who can carry a 100 lb tv, so it's a huge production to get fixed and he's saying it will be at least 550. If he picks it up. In 60 years I've owned 3 tvs, all of them lasted 10 to 20 years before i had to do any work on them except this one. Right now, ready to through over the hill and cancel the cable. What kind of crap is this that you pay well over 1000. For something and it works a year. Don't pay a big price for any of TV's regardless of brand. Terrible product. Don't waste your money. They all know these tv's suck and they don't care, all they want is your money.<br /><br />Update: I changed the main board and t con myself, neither fixed the tv. The next part to change is the panel and that part is 1600. I'm furious that all these manufacturers are making tv's that last under two years. Look at all the reviews, all the LED tv's are junk, all Have a design flaw, especially the bigger ones. My tv repairman said all LED tv's will have to be worked on about every 3 or 4 years and most times the repair parts are more than the tv. So right now I'm looking for a dump or recycling place that will take electronics and someone with a truck to carry it off.  i will never pay more than 200. On any LED tv again.

Product does not come with enough hardware to mount all brands of televisions. Only two of the 4 screws fit in my 50” Samsung and I could not use the spacers. The mounting screws that come with this product are about an inch long and fit the top holes without the spacers. You will need 2” screws for the bottom and you won’t find these at Home Depot but still can’t use the spacers. Directions are hard to follow but if you have ever installed a mount before you can figure it out until you realize that it is very unclear how to attach the tv to the mount.

I don't know if they're loud enough for a party or a larger space... haven't tried them that way... but they get plenty loud for a bedroom to listen to comfortably. The sound is clear and pleasant. I haven't had any technical issues. Basically, these are good portable speakers.<br /><br />UPDATE: Three and a half years on, and these are still working great!

It can serve as a USB drive, as a microSD card reader over full size USB, a microSD reader over USB-C, and if you have a microUSB OTG cable (and a compatible phone/tablet) it can also serve as a microSD card reader over micro-USB. You can find microUSB OTG cables for under $3, or even less per if you buy multi-packs or look for a promotion.<br /><br />It has no storage of its own, so you have to provide your own microSD cards. The microSD cards go inside the bottom of the full size USB port. You put the microSD card in there, gold connectors up, and gently push it inside. To take the card out, there is a little slider button on the opposite side of the port cover.<br /><br />The full size USB side has a cover (to protect the microSD card), but the USB-C side does not (it doesn't need it).

I used this camera for the first time while I was on vacation in Prague. The quality of the pictures taken outdoors are as good or better than you would expect from a camera with a lens this size. They images are more than adequate for Facebook and printing 4x6s. Photos taken in lower light conditions are grainy but not any more so than I would expect.<br /><br />This review would have been 4 stars if it were not for one single problem. The camera ships without a charger but does include what looks like a micro USB cable.<br /><br />The included cable is actually NOT a micro USB cable but a proprietary Sony cable that looks like micro USB. Having brought only a mini and micro USB to charge everything else I own I was unable to charge the camera.<br /><br />I spent three hours scouting the tourist areas of Prague for a means to charge this camera. I finally gave up and paid twice retail for another camera to use for the remainder of my trip.<br /><br />When I returned home I bought a universal battery charger. I must have figured I had plenty of micro USB cables and tossed the cable that came in the box. If I travel with this camera again I will bring a pocket full of charged Sony 'N' batteries.<br /><br />I can't begin to understand why Sony would do something like this. I thought they would have learned their lesson with the Sony memory stick saga. They have taken another pretty good product a degraded it by making it inconvenient and/or expensive to use.<br /><br />Rick Culleton<br />CEO DiscountElectronics.com,neutral,positive

Unfortunately, I had to return it because it did not do what I needed.<br /><br />This projection screen is made of a translucent, white fabric that is quite stretchy, which are both bad properties to have for a front-projection screen.  Most people will be mounting their projection screen against a wall so being a translucent fabric, much of the projected light passes through the screen and hits the wall, then reflect back on to the screen.  The net effect of this is that there is a fuzzy glow around everything in the image.  Furthermore, being a stretchy fabric, you will end up with ugly curved edges in an effort to mount the screen tightly in order to remove any creases.<br /><br />What you end up with on your wall is something that looks like you skinned a polar bear and a projected image that is akin to looking through a thick layer of fog.<br /><br />I would not recommend this projection screen for anything other than a temporary screen that you might put up because there isn't a flat wall near by (camping?)",negative,negative

"I also own the Bose QC-15, and they have spoiled me.  I bought these hoping they would be a suitable alternative for those times when I needed to pack light, or when the bulk of traditional headphones just wouldn't work.  Subjectively, I would say these remove about half as much noise, maybe less.  There are some situations where they are pretty effective, and some where I can barely tell the difference when I flip the switch on.  And I find any kind of in-ear device to be less comfortable than headphones that surround the ear, but that is a matter of personal preference.  Those with a differently shaped ear canal might find these to be both more comfortable and effective than I do.  Keeping in mind that these are about one fifth the cost (at Amazon prices) of the Bose, I give them an extra star for value.",neutral,positive

"I've been a professional photographer for more than 20 years, so most of my lighting is old school and high quality but gradually falling apart from extended use. I've slowly been replacing things with more modern, programmable LED equipment, often trying less expensive brands such as Neewer with good success. Thankfully the lights themselves in this kit are repurposeable, but unfortunately everything else belongs in the dumpster. The stands are so cheap/lightweight that they can't hold up the weight of the softbox and lights at full extension without falling over. And, they're also so poorly built that the 20-pound sandbag I placed on top to keep them from falling over bent the stand's support. The softbox itself is not Bowens mount compatible so there's really nothing I can do with it. The extension cords are both too short and integrated with the unit controls, rendering them useless as well. The bag is nicely sized but extremely thin with a dubious-quality zipper. I doubt it'll last for more than a few uses and it has a horrible rubber/plastic smell as do the softbox bags. All-in-all, I've got more use for the box this pile of junk came in than I do for the lighting kit. I cannot recommend it... Look for better built brands.",negative,positive

"meh.  I've had a different, smaller pair of swarovski's for 15 years - which I LOVE!!!!  I waNted to splurge on something to use only during migration when I'm willing to carry something a bit heavier for the slight improvement in light and field of view.  But, I'm not too excited by these.  The eye relief thing just falls off - frequently.  I switch back and forth between wearing contacts or glasses or sunglasses constantly, so I'm always needing to adjust the eye relief - but on these, whenever I go to adjust this, it just screws off the whole eye piece.  It can be quite difficult to get the eye relief to adjust and NOT screw off the piece.  I even returned the first paiR, thinking I'd got a bad pair.  Nope, second pair is the same.  And, it's not just hard to adjust - I've just had the whole eye piece fall off several times.  So far, only inside the case or once inside my car but one of these days it's going to fall off on the ground and I'm not going to notice until I've walked away.  For this price, I really expect something made better - my 15 year old pair is more reliable.  Because of swarovski's reputation, I wonder if the seller is selling an odd lot?

"***update***: I tried to get a replacement but it didn't arrive (not anker fault) so I got a refund! However anker customer service was superb and pro consumer so if u have issues contact them. But my honest opinion is don't buy these unless u want this particular style, get the anker liberty 2 pro those are phenomenal in price and performance! They are not perfect but worth the buy over air pods and maybe even the Samsung Galaxy buds.<br />*Please note this isn't a full product review due to the possibility of receiving a defective product (it happens) and it no way relates to fully functioning product, will return for a replacement*<br />So I'll say this off the bat I'm super suspicious about wireless Bluetooth headphones because one they don't sound as good as wired and don't even know if they ever will, they drain phone battery life and just lack innovation and not durable. I received my Anker liberty air 2 due to positive review from flossy carter on youtube.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- I love the aesthetic in terms of color (yes my favorite colors are black and red) it looks great and the red looks super cool inside the ear tip and bottom lining.<br />-Bluetooth range was actually pretty good and i can be in the bathroom while my phone is charging in the room without it cutting off.<br />-Sound quality as is (no eq settings) actually pretty good, I was surprised at how good they sounded for wireless tho not as good as my pc/ gaming audio Technica mx50  with an Aune amp/DAC.<br />-the case overall looks very good and feels nice, not cheap plastic or flimsy, this also for the earbuds.<br />- good selection of tips and nice ear tip holder. tho not sure about the right ones for me<br />- no jamming the earbuds in your ear when pressing the buttons.<br />-No Video delay or lip-synching issues.<br />-not overpriced trash like the apple air pros.<br />cons:<br />-this one is subjective: don't like the apple air style of headphones tho these don't look as dumb and ghetto as the apple ones.<br />- the eq settings on the app tho the preset settings are ok and do help make them sound better it would be better to keep those but also allow the user to mess with frequencies as actual EQs do.<br />-no dedicated volume buttons: this is a must for me like yes u can use the app to change it but it is burdensome to do so and doesn't work well. the double-tap has a delay and the pressing down doesn't  change the volume fast enough<br />-Left earbud cuts off from time to time worse on calls it happens frequently enough to be annoying.<br />- on calls which is one of the main reasons, i got these people sound like my voice sounds muffled and echoes alot compared to my wired sony bass boost earbuds.<br />-Also on call, i experienced distortion of the other person's voice and didn't sound great.<br />- the touch buttons are a bit finicky and there should have more options or buttons to ad functions to<br />- no volume rocker  one-star automatic knock off<br />-the ear fit could be alot better maybe ear tips with wings? it didn't fall off  but does have a tendency to get loose alot<br />-No noise cancelation<br />-experienced alot of random pausing when listening to music",negative,positive

"I spent 12+ hours over several days on setup, testing, and investigation and cannot recommend this camera in its current state due mostly to setup difficulty. If I were not tenacious, I would have thrown this in the garbage and given up. I still have not gotten everything to work, but after reading the other reviews several times and Internet research, I was able to get almost everything working as I wanted it.<br /><br />Once I got this working, the images were pretty good (but distorted) as long as the software was setup up to record in high definition.  Below are the PROS and CONS and my experiences during setup.<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />- The camera is small and except for the lights, unnoticeable.<br /><br />- It comes with mounting screws in case one wants to secure the metal base. However, double-stick tape is provided to mount the metal plate without using the screws.  Since the camera base is magnetic, there may be no need to mount any plate as it can be placed on the fridge, pet playpen, or anything that is metal.<br /><br />- Once the high definition is selected, the picture is pretty good even if slightly distorted. Any other setting except for high definition results in a grainy image.<br /><br />- The camera stores the images on the SD card which is visible through the cloud.  I used a [[ASIN:B013CP5IWO SanDisk Extreme 64GB MicroSDXC UHS-1 Card with Adapter (SDSQXNE-064G-GN6MA)]] in the camera.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />- The camera is unusable unless cloud setup is done and the SD card is initialized. This means that besides a wireless network and SD card, a Smartphone or tablet is needed to download the EZVIZ app.<br /><br />- The setup can be an absolute NIGHTMARE. For some people, things just work. However, for others like me, it takes lots of effort and guesswork to set up the software.<br /><br />- No images are available in the cloud even after cloud setup. When I took the camera offline after hours worth of recording, I was not able to view any stored images. Therefore, the comment that there is cloud storage after setup appears to be untrue based on my results.  When trying to play a video, I got the message &#34;Video playback failed, error code:340405.&#34;<br /><br />- Although I could remove the SD card from the camera and see a list of MP4 and PICT files on my computer, I was unable to view any of them. I tried on both Windows 10 and Windows 7 laptops without success. For the MP4 files, I tried Windows Media Player, IE, Audacity, Movie Maker, and QuickTime. With media player I got the error: &#34;Windows Media Player cannot play the file. The Player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file.&#34; With QuickTime (which is supposed to be able to read MP4 on a file open), I got an &#34;Error -2048: Couldn't open the file hiv00084.mp4 because it is not a file that QuickTime understands.&#34; Since PICT is a Macintosh picture image, for those files I downloaded a trial version of Adobe Photoshop. When opening the PICT files, I got the error message &#34;Adobe PhotoShop CC 2015. Could not complete the request because it is not the right kind of document.&#34; The files that get created on the SD card and which I should be able to open but cannot on a laptop are as follows:<br /><br />hiv00000.mp4<br />hiv00000.pict<br />hiv00001.mp4<br />hiv00001.pict<br />....<br /><br />- The images / videos taken are concave even in high-definition. It was as if I was looking through a drinking glass to view the images.  I assume this may be typical of many cameras, but I cannot be sure. My dashcam images are not distorted like this. The first image I attached via a screen capture demonstrates this. This first image was not in high-definition, instead it was using the default resolution.<br /><br />- The nighttime image is useless if the camera is facing glass (window, mirror, etc.) as you can see from the high-definition second image I attached. (PS Ignore the volume control bar as that accidentally came up when I was taking a screen shot with my other tablet.)<br /><br />- The software is quirky. For example, besides not being intuitive, sometimes the software would not auto rotate on my tablet and other times it did.<br /><br />- This camera is SUPER CREEPY. At night, when I turned off the IR light setting, the camera actually took a picture of the inside of my house even though I had it facing out toward my balcony. In certain situations, it must use the window as a reflector to capture the image behind it when the IR light setting is off. The image taken was very visible even though it was almost in X-Ray looking form.  I was really &#34;creeped out&#34; by this.  (The IR light setting says&#34; When disabled, the image remains colorful with more image noise in dark environment.&#34; &#34;When enabled, the image turns black and white with clear image in dark environment.&#34;}. What this is supposed to mean is the image in front of the camera; not behind it.<br /><br />MY SETUP EXPERIENCE<br /><br />Most people do not have to worry about this but since I have MAC address filtering security set on my router, I needed the MAC address of the camera for the router to allow the camera to connect. The MAC address is not in the documentation, but I accidentally found it when I dropped the camera and the camera cover came off. It is written on the main chip below the camera faceplate. Therefore, the steps I took for setup were:<br /><br />- Added the MAC address of the camera into my router's MAC address filtering list.<br /><br />- Inserted the 64GB micro SD card into the tiny slot on the side of the camera as per the instructions.<br /><br />- Plugged in camera.<br /><br />- Downloaded the EZVIZ app from Google Play (since I have an Android device) on my Google Nexus 7 tablet.<br /><br />- Once installed, I opened the app. The screen displayed was nonsensical. There were stick drawings in the center and if I rolled my fingers from left to right it scrolled around the screen. I assume the app was designed for those who understand images with no words. Since I did not, I exited the app and and re-opened it. It was then that I got a different screen that enabled me to start to creating an account.<br /><br />- Once I typed in my email address and password I wanted, I hit finish. The book does not detail what is supposed to be done. It assumes everyone knows.  I got a message that said &#34;Operation failed; failed to get the verification code. (99999).&#34; After trying several times, I quit for the second day in a row. I even wrote the company but they never responded.<br /><br />- The next day I tried again but this time I clicked on the check mark on the keyboard when I was done inputting my email and password and that worked.<br /><br />- I attempted to add my camera after sign-in by clicking on the + sign as directed in the manual. It's at this point that I was asked to log into my network. Even though the network and password was correct, the login failed. I even disabled the MAC address filtering temporarily and tried again. Still no luck. I then wired this directly to the USB port on my router and it still failed with the message  &#34;Operation failed. Please try again. (102000).&#34;  I had enough and quit for the day.<br /><br />- The next day, I re-read the reviews on Amazon. User Leslie mentioned in her review that &#34;the specs for the camera say it works on a 2.4GHz band.&#34;  She said that she set her &#34;phone to only use the 2.4 band and not roam to the 5GHz band.&#34; That made me realize that I had to connect my Google Nexus 7 to the 2.4GHz band and not the 5GHz band. I mistakenly assumed that the camera was picking up my wireless network and trying to connect. It appears that it has to use the band of the phone or tablet to connect. Once I did this, I was able to add the camera by following the remaining directions in the book--scanning the QR code on the camera, etc. etc.<br /><br />- I attempted to complete the rest of the instructions related to setup through device settings but that also was impossible to find. I eventually discovered that by tapping on the &#62; sign next to my camera name (it's the &#62; to the right that you can see in the first picture I attached), I would get to settings. I was looking for a gear icon but that's not how you get to settings in this software. Once I found the settings it was pretty easy to initialize the SD card, change the device password, etc.<br /><br />- The next problem I had was actually seeing more than the image on the screen. In order to set up high definition, you have to click on the image itself. It's at this point that I was able to change the settings to full-screen mode, change from basic, standard, or HD images, take a picture, capture a recording, or turn the sound on or off.<br /><br />In summary, I cannot recommend this camera due to the setup hassles, distorted video, inability to read the files on the SD card without the app, and the difficulty of navigating around the EZVIZ software. Also, the fact that changing one setting displays the contents of a person's house even if the camera is pointing toward a parking lot, is SUPER CREEPY. It also records conversations almost one room away. I unplugged mine and may only plug it in from time to time when I'm out of the house because this concerns me.  Another thing to be wary of is the legal ramifications of recording voice and video; however, that applies to any recording or video capturing device and is not an issue specific to this camera.<br /><br />UPDATE Nov 24, 2015 --&#62; I finally figured out how to access cloud storage when my unit was offline. I clicked on the picture and then clicked on the blue gallery bar at the bottom of the screen.  From there I selected the bar above SD and then was able to pick a date from a calendar. Once I did this, I was presented with a list of pictures to choose from.",negative,negative

So it's just long enough to not fit. I wouldn't have bought it had I known it's true measurements.<br />I figured I could still use it with my MP3 player at my desk, but I have to have the volume down real low on my player otherwise the speakers sound distorted. It's not bad, and does okay for such a tiny speaker, and honestly what did I expect for $6.00.",negative,positive

"When I fist got these headphones, they worked perfectly. The battery life was pretty good, they sounded great; nothing was wrong. Over the past couple months however, they have started to have connection issues. I thought it was just my phone at first because a different pair I have was cutting out too. But no, it's definitely the headphones. Sometimes I can have my phone in my pocket, no more than 2 feet from the headphones, and the connection starts to cut in and out as if I am 30 feet from them. Sometimes I can deal with the spotty connection, but other times it cuts in and out a couple times per second repetitively until I turn the headphones off then on again.",neutral,positive
"4.5 stars *UPDATED* 3 stars flat<br /><br />Only 1 Pro left after initial glee:<br />Color is nice. That's about it now that this has a couple weeks use...<br /><br />*UPDATED* material is breaking down already. Does not fit as snugly after just a couple weeks. There is a lot of weakening and material is gapping and less snug. Even at this price, there should be more quality. I didn't expect this to be falling apart so soon with such gentle use.<br /><br />The other Cons remain:<br />The outer part of the case is slightly slippery & I will need to be careful.<br />The Home key of the tablet is just the slightest bit obscured by the holder, but just very slightly.<br />With the case open and folded back, the material feels flimsy and the flap is wiggly/flimsy.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />This is cheaper than the price indicates/warrants!  Only good enough for the very shortest use.<br />I'm tossing this asap and getting something better. That's what I get for taking chance. My device deserves better than this.",neutral,positive
"I have Echo's all throughout my house.  But, as a writer, I quickly learned that recently, distraction has now become the norm with Echo Show. Pop-Up Ads show up every 5-10 seconds, disrupting my photo collection and my train of thought. And then to integrate Avatar items into responses is annoying as can be! No, I don't want to play all those games you are showing continuously. I've contacted Amazon and was told that they are paid ads and I cannot remove them or refuse them. Look at Jeopardy Ads, 1 minute apart.  NEW: I pay for Amazon Prime music and expect to see what is playing and if there are lyrics, to see them, but just now they've added a new wrinkle. Music playing while a SPONSORED AD is showing !!! Music now stops playing for no reason and Sponsored Ads pop up. I have to begin my playlist all over again! Greed has gone extreme! I pay for the Prime Music monthly, I DO NOT WANT THE ADS popping up while playing music!!! You've gotten out of control Amazon! What's next? Sponsored Ads while Video calling family? I planned on getting the Echo speaker, but not now because I fear it's only a matter of time before Echos without screens start offering the ads out of nowhere. I pay for cable w/o ads, but I can't stop the Echo from showing ads.<br />Latest review 2/19/23<br />Now it has a new twist since I play music on all Echo devices at the same time... It suddenly stops playing so it can show a sponsored ad, but then does not resume playing. I loop my playlist and it just stops to show ads and I have to begin the playlist all over again. What's next? Showing ads when I am speaking to a family member when on a call? Obviously, greed has NO boundaries.",negative,negative
"The quality of the case is good, but it’s very bulky and heavy, making it hard to hold while laying in bed to read.<br /><br />To be fair, I have small hands. I bought the case in hopes to make the kindle easier to hold (the oasis is slippery. My other kindles have an almost rubber feel to the backs of them). However, because it’s bulkier, and the straps sit behind the kindle, I can’t reach them comfortably to turn the page.<br /><br />If you don’t have child sized hands like I do, this would likely be a great case for you.

"The display on this Digital Photo frame is very high quality.  I set mine to the calendar mode showing the month and time as well as photos that slowly revolve.  Setup is easy. There is movie (which can be accessed from a Thumb Drive, An SD Card or a Micro-USB port.  The quality of the movie is good, but the sound is tinny and not remarkable.  The next mode is Photo which can also be accessed through the above three sources.  Music is the next mode, again from the three sources.  File is the next mode which can be anything you have in a folder from the three sources, Clock/Calendar is another mode which is obvious and the last (but first mode you use) is Settings.<br /><br />The Frame is capable of being set to fourteen different languages which is impressive.  The screen’s brilliance, tone and appearance can be set in many ways through the remote control.  This is the problem I had – the remote control.  As you can see in the picture it is small.  It runs on a 3V battery.  The actual setup of the remote Is not bad, but the keys stick shut.  I have to pluck at them to release.  Sometime it takes several pressings to get a button to work.  In short, I am amazed that such a nice Digital Photo Frame has such a cheap remote control.  There is the option of using seven buttons on the back of the Frame that duplicate the remote, but that is nearly impossible to see the screen and maneuver the buttons.<br /><br />The frame comes with a small 3-inch mount that was slightly difficult to insert into the hole.  You can mount it on a wall with a hole that is supplied, but the battery cord enters on the side which causes the frame to hang at an angle.  To over some this I used tape to have the power cord hang from the center of the frame.  These are design flaws that can easily be changed.<br />To be fair, the manufacturer accepted a return from my first non-working Frame and supplied another, but the remote is the same.  They are in the process of sending me a new Remote.  When I receive that, I will update this review.",neutral,positive

"I was motivated to get one of these after a couple of my friends had them. I wasn't sure but I went ahead and decided to try. The first one I got had issues with syncing correctly and I had to manually reset about 4 times per day. I knew this wasn't normal because my friends didn't have this issue. So I exchanged it for free from Amazon with no problems.<br /><br />I'm finding it just motivates me to get off my butt and walk more.  I get excited to see how many steps I can walk and badges I can earn. I also like competing with my friends to see who is getting the most steps in.  Today I finally got first place for the first time! Woo Hoo!  But I like the motivation. I made myself get up and walk around the block a couple times before work today, and I make myself get up and walk around the office and even outside multiple times per day. In the beginning I was finding that 10,000 steps was kind of hard and there were days I wasn't getting 10,000 in.  But just 3 weeks later I have it set to 15,000 steps a day because 10,000 became easy! So now I'm trying to get 15,000/day in!!!<br /><br />I'm not losing a ton of weight but that's because I'm not necessarily eating perfectly. I need to work on that. I have days that I do well but then the weekend comes and I don't do well... but even without the perfect eating I'm still down about 2.5 pounds in the 3 weeks because of just the moving moving moving all the time.<br /><br />I did not take it with me one day when I went to the water park.  I have seen mixed reviews on swimming, some people say they've taken it swimming many times with no issues and some say they've gone swimming and it died.  So I just don't want to risk it.<br /><br />So yes, so far so good!",positive,positive

It does!<br />Let's get the &#34;bad&#34; out of the way: It's so tiny that it's all but impossible to place without thin fingers, a steady hand, and tweezers. Also, the cover pops out when exposed to a VERY strong magnet. Stronger than you'd ever bring near your computer. However, the good FAR outweighs the bad:<br />1. It's incredibly thin -- thin enough even for my MBP with touchbar<br />2.

Fits my 15.6 Dell almost perfectly, with just a bit of overhang on either side.<br />5. Comfortable on my lap. No sharp or irregular protrusions.<br /><br />The bad:<br />1. If you press on the bottom while lifting, the case will grind against the fan.<br /><br />The ugly:<br />1. Exposed metal with somewhat sharp edges around the pass-though USB plug. This can cut, and will still hurt even if it doesn't actually cut, if you move your hand the wrong way - for example, while lifting the laptop to move it.<br /><br />Overall I'd say it's worth getting, especially if the price is low... but watch out for that sharp edge.",neutral,positive

"The biggest thing is that these are meant to be true wireless stereo headphones, and they're not - all the manual says is that they will automatically connect to each other after turning on and before connecting to a phone; I left them in TWS pairing mode for several minutes without them connecting.<br />I was able to connect to them as two separate devices and got mono sound through both simultaneously. The sound quality wasn't as bad as I've heard on cheap headphones, but it was in the lower 20% - they're basically just very small (and cheap) speakers that sit above the ear canal. There is no bass, and mids/treble are a bit flat. They also do not get very loud due to the design. I will say that I like the concept of having them fit into the top part of the ear and project down and into the canal, but the execution was poorly done.<br />If I wanted to run dual-output every time I use them, I think they would work well for audiobooks and podcasts, as the vocal range are the frequencies the headphones favor most, and I typically don't feel the need to crank the volume on my audiobooks.",neutral,positive

"We've been using the Ring Doorbell 3 for the past few days now, and it is very hit or miss (mostly miss). The picture quality is ok, it's actually better at night without the sun glare heavily distorting the camera. But the motion detection, and even more-so the notification timing, leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />I've gone through the settings and setup motion zones, tried toggling ""People Only Mode"" on\off and adjusted the sensitivity rate, and nothing really hits the mark. We often get notifications of motion when nothing is there, a plant shifted in the wind, or a car is driving down the street. However, on 3 occasions now, we've had packages delivered right to our front door.... and nothing from ring. Nothing was recorded, no notification, no anything. Kinda defeats the purpose right?<br /><br />But if I walk out my front door, it will detect that. Also when a legit event is captured, by the time we receive the notification on our phones, the person has already left (such as me walking outside to get the mail, and walking back in before notification hits). Not sure what the deal is, but very unimpressed so far. I also picked up the Ring Chime Pro, and that will be getting returned to Amazon ASAP. Thinking the Ring Doorbell 3 will accompany the Chime on its journey back to the warehouse.<br /><br />7 month update:<br />Yeah... I'm not a fan of this Ring doorbell at all. Everything I said above still hold true, except I didn't return this where I absolutely did return the Chime (absolute junk). Wifi connection to this thing is just horrible. Since the original review, I relocated the router to be in the middle of the house to give better coverage to the garage, front yard and backyard. Wifi speaker out by the fire pit works great, which is about 100 feet away from the router... the ring doorbell is like 20 feet away and half the time I can't get the video feed to load. The only reason I kept this device is because I've read similar complaints about pretty much every other ""smart"" doorbell.

"I compare the s7 Plus against the new iPad Air 4th generation and against the Galaxy s7 tablet. The s7 plus won hands down.  If you are not used to Android which has an 80% market share over the entire world and about a 45% market share in the US, there are some things you'd have to get used to.that would be the same if you were going from Android to Apple. The picture on the s7 Plus is the best I've ever seen on a tablet and maybe the best I've ever seen on a computer. The sound quality is also excellent. I returned the iPad Air 4th generation, because the sound was very bright and annoying with hissing s's. With headphones probably not a problem, but I rarely use headphones. The other important factor is that with the Galaxy tabs, there are equalizers available for free that adjust the sound across the board. That means once I set them, I can use them for video, streaming, audio, Pandora, Spotify, anything. There is no such thing for the iPad. Compared to the iPad, the picture quality on the s7 is distinctly better. The picture quality on the s7 Plus just puts the iPad to shame. Not only that, you can fully adjust the color and white intensity on the Android Galaxy. You cannot do that on the iPad. I do find the iPad Air 4th generation, with the new chip, maybe a tiny bit faster but the s7 Plus is fast enough. The s7 plus also has a refresh rate of 120 if I'm not naturally you have to be a little bit more aware of your security on an Android device than on Apple device, but it's just a matter of installing the right apps. For my dollars, even though the s7 Plus is a little heavier and bigger than I need, it's picture quality and sound quality make it the clear choice. I really wanted to get the new iPad Air 4th generation, but it just didn't measure up.<br /><br />There is one huge downfall to this tablet and any Samsung phone as well. Their voice to text is so badly constructed that they should be embarrassed to have it on anything. It's not a matter of how well you speak or how slowly you speak. For example, every time you pause to think a second before you complete a sentence, it starts the next word with a capital. You didn't put a period in and there's no reason it should have done this. Words come up that are meaningless and yet it can't spot them. Other words come up that show that this was clearly made by someone who does not know how to speak English. For this they should be ashamed.",negative,positive

"At first I gave this 5 stars for the ease of use compared to my old lynksys that required tech support and was expensive for what it.  I was getting ok reception from the almond and at first.  Then it would start dropping.  In order for it to get in contact with my home computer.  I would need to unplug it and take it near my computer to get a restart every single time now.  It is a long process to start up, then wait for it to find what it needs to find, then cross your fingers and hope that it connects.  If it does not work then you need to unplug your internet wait then plug that back in to start configuring your almond again.  That usually works and sometimes I get lucky that and the first time works.  Unfortunately while I have typing this re-review it did not take so I will need for the 20th time need to reboot my internet so that the Almond can be happy again.  Fortunately in Feb I bought another range extender that works better for what I need and does not have all this drama.  Unfortunately my husband is still on the almond.

I purchased this a long time ago and decided to hook it up recently.  It can't be trusted to give you an alert when there is motion.  I can watch a car pass my house in real time and yet it will never appear as a motion alert.  My friend today pulled in my drive and we loaded things up in his SUV and then he got in a drove away.  The alert captured him getting in his SUV only.  One night the camera works in the dark and the next night it get little flaring of light about every 10 seconds which blots out the screen for a few seconds.<br /><br />I am purchasing a different one of theirs in the hopes it will work better.,negative,positive

"I got this lens and the 16mm 2.8 with my [[ASIN:B003MPOLX2 Sony Alpha NEX-3]].  The IQ (image quality ) is pretty bad compare to other kit lens.  The is an aps-c camera like the Nikon d3100 (probably the same sensor too) overall the glass elements are much smaller then the d3100 kit.  The image I get has little dynamic range and everything looks contrasty. So I bought a nikkor to sony nex adapter and put my 50mm 1.8 on it.  Wow what a difference, the image is much better.  The bad thing is I have manually focus the nikkor, but that ok for a few shots here and there.  I might say get teh alpha lenses on a sony nex to get better iq.

It had finally run out of space, so I &#34;upgraded&#34; to this Samsung 850 EVO.<br /><br />I cloned the drive and had no problems with that; however, the startup time (from my password screen to the computer completely loaded up) is so very slow compared to the Patriot Pyro when it should be around the same speed or even faster.

"I had become dissatisfied with the video quality of my cheap SD camcorder, so I decided to upgrade. I'd seen an article about the Samsung HMX-Q10 in an online magazine, and it looked interesting. I generally thoroughly research reviews and articles when making a purchase like this, but the HMX-Q10 had just been released, and there were hardly any reviews. I know Samsung has a fairly good reputation for their HDTVs, so I took a chance.<br />Most of the time, video shot with this camera is good, but the camera is quirky and it doesn't always do what it's supposed to. For example, the flip feature, where you're supposed to be able to shoot right or left handed simply by rotating the body, doesn't always work. A couple of times it looked like it was working, but when I imported the file it was upside down.<br />Also, the low-light performance is nothing to write home about. It can take awhile for the autofocus to engage.<br />Though this is a decent machine, if I had to choose again, I'd spend more time researching alternatives.",neutral,positive

"My Apple Pencil tip broke off, and during the height of COVID, multiple electronics stores AND the Apple store near me didn’t have these in stock. I had to buy replacement tips on Amazon.<br /><br />After a frustrating 2 day wait of using a poorly taped-together pencil to do my job, these $20 tips arrived.<br /><br />I’m not quite jazzed about the cost, at a steep $5 per tip. As luck would have it, I dropped my Pencil in the parking lot the following week, ruining another tip with the spiky impressions the asphalt left; dropping and damaging that pencil tip was the same as dropping a $5 bill and watching it blow away.<br /><br />I understand that they’re a necessity, but after having broken/damaged a few tips now in just half a year, the durability isn’t what I would expect for that price tag—especially from Apple.

"Out of the box, I was pretty impressed by the looks. And there wasn't much to disappoint after handling them a little bit. The pleather, both on the band and on the cups, is supple and comfortable. The stitching on the band is even and looks like it'll hold up for a while. Finishing on the plastic cups is pretty good, too. The only misgiving I had about the build was the paint on the hinged part of the headphone had rubbed off a bit.<br /><br />They fit well on my head and I had no complaints after taking them out for a walk with my dog. They even stayed in place while I was playing with my cat!<br /><br />The sound has a few peculiarities that I can't ignore. When I fired them up for the first time I noticed a distinct hiss. I couldn't hear it at mid-high volumes - but if you're in a quiet room on low volume you're definitely going to notice it. If you power the headphones off and instead directly connect them to your music player with a cord, there is no hiss. I think they sound much better in passive mode (cord attached)… tho I bought these for bluetooth sooo...! The other sound problem I have is that when you press the buttons it's actually pretty loud. I wish they would have put in quieter buttons or put more sound insulation between the buttons and my ear.<br /><br />I noticed in the manual they actually have a bass boost function! I tried it out, it definitely adds bass. These are already pretty bassy IMO, so not that important to me, but it was kind of a cool thing that I wasn't expecting.<br /><br />Overall I'm satisfied with these, I think they deserve somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. They'll be great for going out on walks or doing activities where I need to listen mid-high volume. The controls work good although it took a little while to acclimate to the various button commands. If these ever break and I have to replace them, I probably will try something else.<br /><br />Update (13 March 2018):<br />I've been running with these for about a month now, and I have a few more things to say. First, the 40 hour battery life is real. It's really, really, actually what I got. This was very impressive. I've charged these once and have used them almost every day. Second, just for fun I tried out some aftermarket cushions (see link at bottom). The headphones felt good to begin with, but I think they improved the look and feel from stock.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B075M4TRWR Wicked Cushions ath m50x Replacement Ear Pads - Compatbile with ATH M50 / M50x / M40 / M40X / Sony MDR / Shure SRH 440 / monoprice 8323 / takstar hi 2050 And More Oval Shaped Headphones]]<br /><br />I also have another little nitpick. I wish the wires connecting the headphone band to the cups could be longer. They restrict the range of motion of the cup and I'm a little worried that since the wire restricts the motion rather than the headphone frame, there is risk of me breaking it some time down the line. I My M-Audio Q40s, on the other hand, have cups that can rotate all the way around (see picture) so there is no risk of ever breaking the wires simply by rotating the cups too far.<br /><br />In other news, Avantree reached out to me and noted that they were looking into the button noise that I mentioned. It's cool that they're reading this feedback and are interested in improving their product. I'm looking forward to seeing even better headphones from them in the future.",neutral,positive

"If you are looking for a dirt cheap back-up camera that does just what it needs to do, this may be the product for you. First of all, the build quality is pretty weak. The strip that attaches to your license plate is not particularly well built. It seems to be made out of painted aluminum and is easily bent in your hand, like a soda can. Pretty much anyone could snip the camera off the back of your car with a pair of scissors from the dollar store. Fortunately, the item is cheap enough so that replacing it is more of a big hassle than a big expense.<br /><br />The camera performs as well as you would expect. Definitely not high definition, but enough to see where you are going. It probably works better in night mode as objects seem easier to see with IR lighting and with less color there are less distractions.<br /><br />The user ""manual"" is nearly useless.

In a package of less than 2 pounds and measuring 6 x 9 x 1 inches, you have the logical extension for your smartphone, giving you a very sharp 8 inch screen, a suprisingly usable keyboard, two USB slots that can be used to hold flash drives.<br /><br />  You connect your smartphone via a USB cable or Bluetooth and you have everything you need to do your business. Essentially, you've just tied a dumb terminal to your smartphone. There's no software to load, no settings to fiddle with, no hassles or problems.<br /><br />  Your smartphone screen is now on the 8"" Redfly screen. Instead of the miniscule keyboard on your smartphone, you use the surprisingly capable Redfly keyboard. (I'm not sure of how they did it, but the less-than-full-size Redfly keyboard doesn't feel cramped to my large hands.)Connectivity and application software are supplied by your smartphone.<br /><br />  Quite frankly, the Redfly allows you to go without your laptop on many occasions. You can use Windows Mobile Office or pick up one of several office-like applications that are more powerful. Adobe Acrobat Reader (or a third party programs) allows you to readPDF files comfortably. You can browse with your smartphone's install of Internet Explorer, Opera, Skyfire or other browser.<br /><br />  It is a pure hoot to use this two pound wonder. You can throw it into a small bag and carry it everywhere. The idea of harnessing the power of your smartphone, leveraging its connectivity, built-in computing power and applications. Plug in a flash drive, which are now available in 64GB capacities, and there's little in the way of typical productivity work you can't get done.<br /><br />  The rechargeable battery will last 8 - 9 hours on a charge and recharge your smartphone over a USB connection.<br /><br />  Are there drawbacks? Yes. You are limited to the capabilities of your smartphone, so viewing online Flash movies will most likely be out of the question and your smartphone processor may not be anywhwere near as speedy as you would like when you are banging out a long memo. The battery is not removable: there are people who need even more than 8 or so hours on a charge. The power adapter does not have foldable prongs which makes it unnecessarily difficult to pack in a carrying bag.<br /><br />  Beyond that, the Redfly comes close to being an act of technological brilliance. It takes advantage of the increasing power of smartphones and makes them more usable, without making the technology more complex. Nice move!<br /><br />  My review, by the way, is based on the C8 model, which is the same as the C8N except for the plug-in video import capability.<br /><br />Jerry",positive,positive
"I don't care if you have pounds of laptop screws you had the newbies extract from retired machines before the nice man took them off to the great electronics recycling bin in the sky, you should have at least one of these kits in the office at all times. No more trying to distinguish between the pitch on a 1.5mm machine screw, this tells you exactly what you are getting and where it is. Does it have everything? No. But just about - everything that you would need for typical laptop repair, for Dell systems anyway. I used to scrap and save screws in my desk so I'd have a few available, but this kit will save me all that time and annoyance for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />The box is decent,but could be a little higher-quality, since you don't want the screws bouncing between parts of the tray, or the whole thing bursting open if it falls off the table. It's serviceable, but may consider getting your own pill-sorter type box with individually latching compartments instead.<br /><br />PC techs - buy it, even if you have to use your own money. It's worth the 15m of your wage you'll use to pay for it.",positive,positive

"Good quality and build. But I am knocking off 2 stars for lack of innovation. The manufacturer could include a polarity switch in main body OR could have designed the coupler in a way that we could have reversed the polarity - something that I have seen manufacturers have done at least 10 years ago. Of all the gadgets in my home, one works on opposite polarity and so a polarity switch/ mechanism would have worked for me....",neutral,positive

"I have had good fortune with Verbatim products in the past, particularly blank CDs. I was excited to try this thumb drive and it has worked out well for me so far. The biggest plus is the size of the whole unit.<br /><br />This is a 32GB drive which is a good size for most things anymore. It is good as a mass storage device but it also is suitable as boot media if you need to use it for recovery media, OS replacement or other things. There are bigger thumbs drives out there, but this one is big enough for most.<br /><br />It comes preformatted with a FAT32 file system which makes it easy to read by practically all modern operating systems. My Linux system is able to mount it and read it, and Windows 10 opens it automatically. I likely will reformat it though for a better-performing file system to use primarily on my Linux system.<br /><br />I looked on the drive for hidden files and found only the system volume stuff.<br /><br />I did not make notes on the read/write speeds but it seems to perform on par with other name-brand drives I have. I have worked with drives that are quite slow when copying larger files like ISO images; this one seems about average when compared to Sandisk and PNY drives.<br /><br />Where this drive really distinguishes itself, though, is in the very small size, which is good but also could be a problem. It folds up to about the size of a nickel (approximately) and easily fits in a change pocket. This keeps it out of the way and makes it easy to toss in a bag, purse, pocket or backpack even when it’s full. However, it also means it can easily find its way into the laundry.<br /><br />So far, I have no complaints with this drive and am happy to recommend it. It performs well, it is easily recognized on different platforms and is small enough to go just about anywhere.",positive,positive

"OK, these ear phones are comfortable to wear and I like the 'folding&#34; feature. Now about the sound.  I have been a professional musician all my life - acoustic, rock and country - so sound is important to me.  I like a crisp and clear sound with a balanced sound. The sound is good.<br />Since writing this first review I have used them for travel - two plane rides to and from London, UK out of Miami FL USA.<br />As someone else noticed they are bulky and take up a lot of space in carry on luggage.I wore them for about five of the eight hour flight and they were comfortable. Even without the noise cancelling feature they greatly reduced the cabin noise. Listening to movie soundtracks the sound was very good indeed - not surprisingly, far superior to the video quality of the small screens. When I listened to the audio music feed provided on BA, the quality was good, still a bit bass heavy but not too bad. I realize that sound is very much a personal taste and some people prefer much more bass than I do and I've played bass professionally.<br />One of my problems with the sound was probably because I am used to wearing passive cans with no amplification in the set themselves. These obviously are amplified and the sound is boosted far more than in passive cans.<br />For the price, these are good head-phones.",positive,positive

"This is a great antenna.  In all fairness, most modern antenna's are pretty good, so it really comes down to nuances such as aesthetics and what can get you the best placement (ie if a flat antenna can go on your window).  This is an amplified model, and depending on your needs, you may prefer to save a few bucks unamplified (amplification not only isn't a panacea, it can make things worse).  Then again, it's easy to add or remove the amp as needed, so maybe it's best to go this route even if you're not sure you'll need it, as you can try it and put it away if it doesn't help.<br /><br />As noted above this antenna works well.  I picked up the same channels (unamplified) as my unamplified Mohu Leaf (which I also consider to be excellent) in my Columbus, OH condo (~10 miles from most stations and 25 miles from the harder to reach stations (which need ideal placement to reach).  The signal is crisp and clear (way better than Uverse HD), and it works great directly connected to my TV and via HD Homerun.<br /><br />All in all, as great as this is (I recommend it), I feel the same way about the Leaf (and the Amazon Basics knock off model I tested as well).  There are many great antennas out there.  If you don't have one, get one.  This is a good one.  Put it in a window facing stations for best results.<br /><br />The amp is much better ( I can get distant channels better while not souring closer ones) than the Mohu one (it did the opposite--didn't pull distant channels and soured some nearby ones) included in the [[ASIN:B00APPDX86 Mohu Leaf 50 TV Antenna, Indoor, Amplified, 50 Mile Range, Original Paper-thin, Reversible, Paintable, 4K-Ready HDTV, 16 Foot Detachable Cable, Premium Materials for Performance, USA Made, MH-110584]].  I'm no expert, but the one included here is a 12v one, where the Mohu one uses USB power (which I think makes it 5v).  It could also be the tiny unshielded integrated cable Mohu uses, while here you can use your own (the included cables aren't great, so I went with thick quad shielded RG6 cables).",positive,positive

"Thought I was upgrading from my 8 year old Sena SMH-10 system. What a massive disappointment!<br /><br />We Snowmobile as a family of 4.  We have an 8 year old and 12 year old so reliable communication is absolutely necessary.<br /><br />First: the range is a complete lie. We were lucky to maintain 4 way communication up to 300 feet. The 1.6 kilometer claim is simply absurd. Maybe in a desert, with a clear line of sight, but not in a forested region with hills.<br /><br />Next, one of the fixed microphones failed completely after only 3 days of use. What the heck? I'm on a snowmobiling vacation and I have one helmet with no Mic.<br /><br />Next, there was never a time when all of us could hear each other with saying. ""What?"" ""Say that again"" ""Did you hear me?!!""<br /><br />My old Sena suffered from crackling sound and refused to update, and the majority of reviews suggested that Cardo was the best. NO WAY. In real world use, on the trail, in snowstorms, I can say that all four of us were very disappointed, and that's putting it mildly.  keep in mind, that's just for the 4 way Digital Mesh Communication, which is all we care about.  Listening to music and taking calls, etc., mean nothing when the most basic function fails.<br /><br />I've had to factory reset 3 times in 4 days just to keep a semblance of communication,  and my finger-tips are sore from how harsh the buttons are to press trying to achieve the factory reset.<br /><br />I feel I was completely duped out of nearly $1000.00.<br /><br />Anyone that wrote a story, a review, or magazine column extolling the virtues of these communicators for snowmobiling either never used them for that purpose for more than a few minutes under perfect conditions, or is was simply disingenuous. Either way, their journalistic license should be suspended and or revoked!<br /><br />I should have followed my gut and upgraded with the latest Sena, or maybe Uclear.<br /><br />I would absolutely NOT recommend these communicators to anyone, even the people I don't like.",negative,negative

"So please take my review with a grain of salt. Unpacked it, very easy to figure out. No instructions needed. First three 'tests' photos came out very very slowly but in focus, quality of photo is not as we see advertised but good enough and will serve my purpose. What I did not read before I purchased nor saw when I went looking for it today after reading in the booklet that we need, "" Connect a compatible micro USB cable and charger, 1amp or greater to the camera"". This should be offered, or it should come with the camera period. This is my only issue with this purchase THUS far. I got the yellow, thought it was orange because I didn't pay attention. Had I known it was yellow I would've gone with pink or blue. Oh well. Small dislike. No biggy.<br /><br />UPDATE: The first time I used this camera (upon arrival) was to try it out and used three sheets. Supposed to come with 10 sheets. Today (03/08/22) used this camera for the second time and only got 2 prints (total of 5)! Cheated out 5 sheets. Also the camera kept turning off in-between the two prints because I guess it needs to be charged and no USB was included.

"I have used these on a few plane trips and I am overall pleased with my purchase.  They do an adequate job of reducing noise levels and the audio playback quality is good for in ear headphones.  The only reason I am giving the product 4 stars instead of 5 is the sound quality of the headphones.  They are certainly good headphones for the price, but I probably will only use them for flying.  I am comparing these with slightly more expensive Senheiser over the hear NC headphones.  I should also add that I did not use the compression ear plugs provided with phones that might have removed more noise and improved perceived sound quality.",positive,positive
"I received a review sample and put these through their paces. I want to disclose that I enlisted the aid of a friend to test these because she loves ear bud style headphones and is a demanding consumer.<br /><br />Both of us tested the sound quality and we were both impressed. For me the album [[ASIN:B00136JQMI Kind Of Blue]] is the acid test because of the number of instruments and the dynamics and subtleties of the music. After I connected these to the 3.5mm jack on my Galaxy Note II I was treated to spectacular sound quality. While these are not noise-canceling phones the ambient noises in my car were completely attenuated.  My friend tried these out with her iPhone 4S and could not only clearly hear folks to whom she was calling, but they confirmed that she was coming in crystal clear on their end. That confirms that the microphone is of the same excellent quality as the phones.<br /><br />I found these to be extremely comfortable, which is saying a lot because I am not an ear-bud person. In fact I fell in love with them, but gave them to my friend as a token of my appreciation for her help in evaluating them.<br /><br />Construction is impressive. The 3.5mm is gold plated and the cable is heavy-duty with strain reliefs. Even the in-line mic switch is sturdy.<br /><br />There are some wonderful touches in the packaging and included components starting with one of each size of ear gels (small, medium and large). The phones also come with a nice carrying pouch that is not only attractive, but also functional.<br /><br />Overall these are premium quality earphones that will please even the most finicky audiophiles. They are a perfect solution for folks who use their phones as an MP3 player because you can immediately switch into answer or call more with a flick of a switch.",positive,positive

"The sound quality is good but it doesn't have much range. I read many of the reviews & agree with other reviewers - this is not a room speaker - it doesn't begin to have the sound/range needed to fill a large room (such as living room or kitchen). Maybe a small bedroom or closet or bathroom; anything bigger and the speaker is dwarfed by the room. I wanted a portable bluetooth speaker so I could broadcast Sirius XM while cooking or working around the house. I'd hope to be able to hear it as I moved around the house but it just doesn't have the range. You can barely hear it in the next room. Agree with the other reviewer(s) - you'll need a bigger & more expensive speaker if that's your goal. For example: If you were in a hotel room & set it on the TV console, I doubt you could hear it well enough, to discern words, in the bathroom. If you're in a small room, where sound can bounce off the close walls, it'll work just fine.",neutral,positive
"Tragically there are very few things I'm an expert in, but sound is one. I listen to 5 hours of music every day on headphones on full volume and I've done that for 25+ years. I've had at least 120 headphones, literally.<br /><br />After watching countless youtube reviews praising the XM4 as the best NC headphones money could buy today I finally picked one up. I'm now highly suspicious of those reviews. They were likely paid for or perhaps free headphones were given out. The one thing the youtubers know you can't do is listen for yourself. If you actually heard the sound coming out of these headphones it would be instant rejection. The hype is just that. Kudos to Sony's marketing team.<br /><br />That's not to say this is a bad product. The engineering is top notch. The app is perfect. Hardware is well designed and built to last. Battery seems to never die. Exceptionally light. Stylish. They got everything right except for the sound. (!)<br /><br />I think these are low quality speakers but they're being manipulated by some very clever software to imitate more expensive hardware. It's cheating and the sound is somehow counterfeit. It works about half the time and the sound quality occasionally gets close to the Bose QC35II. But often these tricks fail and the output is muffled and cringe worthy. It's almost offensive. Repulsive.<br /><br />This has been marketed to the naive. Judging based on sound these are $40-$80 headphones. The kind of thing you might get given to watch an in flight movie.<br /><br />Don't buy these headphones. Bose QC35II, or the 700, or if you can take wires Sennheiser 660S. These headphones may be useful for students for listening to lectures. Not for music.<br /><br />Update: It's been 48 hours and I'm going back to my 2016 QC35II (stuck together with duct tape). These Sony headphones have a perfect design, but the sound is simply awful. It butchers every other song. I can't listen to another minute.",negative,positive

"I called the customer service line to express my dismay with my new Bluetooth Headset to no avail.  I purchased the HM1700 from Amazon a little over a week ago.  The package had the Samsung Hologram so I thought this was going to be a quality product.<br />I could not have been more wrong.  By day 3 the ear bud had detached from the base and is now hanging by the wires.  I am the first to admit that I do put my phone along with my headset in my purse but never thought the product would fall apart as a result.<br />I had a Plantronics headset the went in my purse, gym bag even my pocket and for 6 years is was a quality, sturdy made product.  Because I use it daily I simply wore it out and decided to give Samsung a try since I bought my three sons the Samsung Galaxy II phone and Christmas and to date they have been very satisfied.<br />All the representative on the phone could say was &#34;sorry it's physical damage and you have voided the warranty&#34;.  I offered to send pictures to show how it came apart but she continued to repeat the same thing as if reading from a script.<br />I wanted to give Samsung a chance to make good on their product even offering to sell a replacement at a 50% discount would have been acceptable but unfortunately that did not happen.  I waited to post my review on Amazon because I wanted to be fair but I feel I must let others know before they waste their money.<br />After combing through the other reviews I noticed this is a common problem so again I have to go back to quality controll at Samsung.",negative,negative

"This case is heavy and cumbersome to use.  on the other hand, it is probably very protective with its double layer design.<br />In my opinion they should've just made it single layer that doesnt compromise on protection too much and made it lighter and less cumbersome.<br /><br />The volume control cut out is flawed. It is EXTREMELY difficult to access the volume and power buttons.<br />It could've been awsome but failed in execution with it's overly complicated design concept.",negative,negative
"Let me get the PRO out first:<br />* Wire free is the biggest plus for this system.  Always nice to be able to install anywhere around the premises without worrying about network cable or power.<br />* Easy to install, especially with the indoor magnet mount.<br />* Looks great, compact and modern looking.<br /><br />Now lets get to the CON sides:<br />* Two of the camera were attached to Arlo Solar Panel.  One of them shutdown automatically due to overheating.  After it cooled down, battery start draining at like 10x the speed.  Prior to the overheating, camera didn't have issue staying fully charged each day.  After overheating, it can barely stay above 40% each evening.<br />* Motion sensor not sensitive enough when you wish it is, but way too sensitive when it shouldn't.  I can walk by the camera back and forth, it may pick up motion 1/2 of the time.  But on a windy day, it will be triggered left and right when the leaves flop around.  Or in the evening when insect flies by/around the camera.<br />* Smart detection is a great concept, and work about 80% of the time.  Occasionally it will mis-classified car as pet or dog as people.  Remaining of the time, it failed to identify the object.<br />* Magnet mount is great, but not suitable for outdoor.  Regular mount is sturdy, but angle usually shift slightly when you tighten the knob.<br />* There are no security of any sort built in to reduce chance of theft.  Anyone can just walk by and snapped it off.  You can place the camera higher, out of easy reach, but video you recorded will not be ideal due to steep angle or may not be as sharp due to distance.<br />* HomeKit support is mediocre and no HomeKit Secured video support.  You are forced to subscribe to their cloud storage plan to use the device.<br />* App sucks.  When you received a notification, tap on it, and you are stuck staring at a blank screen for a while waiting for the video to be download.  The least you can do is show a thumbnail or something.  This not even count the slow app launch, slow FaceID verification, and occasionally take you to the wrong tab.<br /><br />Worst of all is support.  Reported my malfunctioning camera after the overheating issue to support, still to no avail after a few weeks of back and forth.  Each time they will send you a laundry list of things to try, to test, and personal info to provide (e.g. address, phone number, video recording, screenshot, etc).  You go thru the hassle to capture all the info and send it back, only to get a response back a week later with another laundry list.  Repeat that a few times, and you will get the picture of the efficiency.  This is not to mentioned that my first report of issue submitted via arlo.com went unanswered for over a week.  Finally get the ball rolling after a 90min waits for online chat.",negative,positive

This worked well with the mount we already had attached to the wall. Using it allowed us to hang the tv ourselves instead of using a professional to put a new mount on the wall then hang tv. It was hard getting a 55 inch tv up there but with the help of using a dresser to support it we managed. Glad we could save the money.

"This compact camera has an outstanding zoom lens.  And it reaches to 18x zoom quickly with little noise.  Though like most compact digital cameras, the 18x zoom is exaggerated.  It's more like 6x to me.  It has a wide angle lens so it's great for taking group photos.  I didn't have to read the manual to figure out how to use this camera.  It's quite intuitive, the way technology should be.<br /><br />The picture/video quality is not as good compared to my other cameras, which is fine in this low price range.  The colors seem washed out a bit compared to my iPhone 5's and Sony Cybershot's.  Its anti-shake feature seems to work well.<br /><br />Samsung puts the flash at a location where my finger can block it partially, so need to be careful when taking flash photos.  It does not come with a separate battery charger.  We can spend all day taking over 200 photos and a few videos, yet it still have a bit of battery life left.<br /><br />Overall this camera is easy to use, easy to hold and priced right.  If you want a long zoom compact camera at a low price, this is a great buy.  Those who want high quality photos should look elsewhere.<br /><br />Update 4/23/2013 - The SkyDrive upload works now, which allows backing up photos while traveling (without lugging along a laptop.)  Apparently SkyDrive has decided to increase the file size limit.  It does not allow bulk upload.  I need to select each photo to be uploaded, not very convenient when we take 200+ photos in one day.",neutral,positive

"As a departure from an overall review of these headphones, which you can get from pretty much anywhere, I'm going to do a noise cancellation review of the QuietComfort 25s when compared to another popular set of headphones, the Beats Solo 2s.  Unfortunately, I have not had the opportunity to use the most recent Beats Studio headphones, but I did have a somewhat unique comparison situation that I thought would be helpful to relay to anyone considering these $300 QuietComfort 25s.  I purchased the Beats Solo 2s when they came out, and I broke them a few weeks later (my own fault).  Although the additional warranty I had purchased covered accidental destruction of the Beats, I decided to buy these Bose 25s as a replacement while waiting for my replacement Solo 2s.  Again, these two headphones are not even in the same range as far as price and supposed quality-- the obvious competitor to the 25s is the Beats Studio model, but I figured I'd compare the noise canceling properties of both sets of headphones to discern whether or not it was worth spending the extra $100 on these Bose 25s, which place their noise cancellation functionality as one of their top features.<br /><br />My replacement Beats Solo 2s arrived just before a trip to my parents' house.  My 78-year-old mother has become hard of hearing, so she plays her TV at a ridiculously high volume that is almost unbearable to listen to with (relatively) young ears.  I took this as an opportunity to compare the noise cancellation properties of the Bose 25s to the Beats Solo 2s.  The results were surprising to say the least, especially given the fact that the Bose headphones have a special noise cancellation switch while the Beats do not.  In this environment, I tried both headphones on my FiiO X1 DAP with the same lossless songs on the same setting-- Given that the battery-powered Bose headphones have a dedicated noise-reduction function, I would've expected them to cancel out all surrounding noise.  They did not.  Was it egregiously bad?  Not by a long shot-- I would assume that general white noise would be almost undetectable while using the Bose headphones, but I could clearly hear voices from a loud TV while using them.  Not the point where it ruined my listening experience, but outside noise was definitely audible.  When I switched to the Beats, it was almost like night and day-- I couldn't hear the TV at all.  The Beats have a snugger fit and tighter leather on the ear pads that completely blocked out the sound of the television.  I was shocked to say the least!<br /><br />Does this make the Bose cans a bad set of headphones?  Absolutely not!  Compared to most, they sound pretty great and do an adequate job of blocking noise, but the Beats honestly sound better, and this is coming from someone who genuinely wants and expects the Bose headphones to perform at a higher level.  For me, the Beats just have a richer sound, while the Bose 25s have sort of a shrill treble going on.  I have also owned the older Beats Solo HDs, which had a comparatively muddy bass resonance, but the Solo 2s really sound pretty fantastic, even when compared to the Bose 25s, which are $100 more expensive and should (on paper) sound a whole lot better.  On top of that, the Beats just feel more luxurious and comfortable (for me anyway).  The Bose 25s have this plush cloth upper padding that I can only imagine as being a repository for head sweat, while the beats have a luxe leather upper that feels more high-end and doesn't seem like it would absorb a bunch of strange bacteria (sorry, but it's true).<br /><br />I guess that if you hate the overall trendiness of the Beats brand and want to overpay for some headphones that don't look or sound quite as good, pull the trigger on these 25s, but I don't really see any reason to otherwise.  Don't get me wrong, they are on the higher-end of sound quality to be sure, but I really don't think they're worth it compared to the Beats Solo 2s, which by all estimation should not sound quite as good as they do.",neutral,positive

An example of something smart that the Verizon Fios modem at my parent's house does is just ""Know"" when to forward ports, and instead of using a static IP address to forward ports or be a DMZ host, it can use the hostname.  This router does not let you do anything of the sort like that.

"The case is a very durable piece of technology, however I have a few gripes. First the charging cover is very stiff requiring fingernails to open and has the problem of closing when I want to put in the charge.In addition the charging cover is slightly off center making putting in a charger a real ordeal. Second the stand for the case makes it hard to use while laying down, it’s so small it jabs the legs and tends to fall over on soft surfaces. Although I will say the mechanism that keeps it open is very durable. Finally the strap, though somewhat finicky, allows easy use while walking around.<br /><br />Third, another small gripe I will mention is the cases edges will sometimes give trouble when trying to swipe at edges",neutral,negative

"I own the alpatronics speaker also sold here on Amazon. I expected some declination in the sound quality comparing the two speakers because one is half the price of the other. But, this thing sounds like your phone but with louder volume. Lacks a smooth bass and struggles with warmth and acoustic clarity. I was listening to a Tool song comparing the two speakers to attempt to figure out what is so wrong with this speaker. Just lacks snap I noticed the alpatronics would clearly register snare drum hits like you were in concert where this speaker was just a clap noise without warmth. The bass is completely dependent of it being on a resonate surface that it can turn the surface into a speaker. When I put it on top of my tin washing machine I was very impressed with the bass the unit could provide. However, on my ceramic counter top in my bathroom, zero bass transmission. Being that I bought it as a shower radio its not working to strongly for me. Other things I don't like lack of song skip buttons, and lack of stereo directional sound. Perhaps the worst thing for me is that it uses a mini rather then micro charge jack so I have to wander my house looking for that specific charge cable every time it needs a charge. It is affordable however. Just not sure why it earns so many high scores here on amazon.<br /><br />Edit 3/3/2014<br /><br />I've used it quite a bit at this point. I've demoted it to my toolbox at work. At normal to low volumes I find the tune it puts out to be acceptable audio quality to work with. Its extremely pint size makes it extremely portable. If your one of those weirdos that walks around with your cell phone belting out songs this will give you a good bump in audio quality playing from a pocket. I find a good nearby place to put it while working so I'm not filling the shop with sound, its a great sneaky radio. Again audio quality is nothing to rave about but it is portable sound and functions quite well decent battery life, bluetooth range, reliability etc. Just if you're a audiophile look elsewhere as there are certainly better units out there.",neutral,positive

"I will post this in different places I.e Samsung, Sony, and Vizio sections.<br />OMG, choosing a car is much easier than a TV. As most people here, I have spent about 4 weeks solid; reviewing tv's, and stalking them as well. I have been to BB, HHREGG, as well as a few other specialty stores, and spent 2 to 4 hours in each store. (i'm retired so i can afford to do so).<br />I have asked the sales people to insert proprietary 3d disks. The only thing that has not been possible is to attach my Xfinity/Comcast cable box to these tv's to compare the difference in picture quality.<br />The first thing that needs to be said is that none of these stores selling said tv's have calibrated them. So some tv's that are highly rated on the internet, look terrible in the store.<br />One example is  the Panasonic 65"" ZT Series Plasma HDTV, which was placed directly in bright lights in the hhregg store. The poor tv looked lousy and dark...Sniff.<br /><br />Another thing that you should know about the reviewer (me) is that I have been actively creating 3d objects and graphics for years. Resolution and color representation are so important to me.<br />Couple this with the fact that I have light to moderate Aspergers. I can focus on microscopic details and differences for hours. Idiotic perfection of sorts. It's a blessing and a curse.<br /><br />The contenders we have selected for purchase (within our budget) as of today are :<br /><br />Sony 65"" XBR Series LED Ultra HDTV<br />Samsung 75"" Series 7 LED HDTV - UN75F7100<br />Sony KDL-70R550A 70-Inch 120Hz 1080p<br />VIZIO M801d-A3 80-Inch 1080p<br />Panasonic 65"" ZT Series Plasma HDTV.<br /><br />As of this writing, we have eliminated the Sony KDL-70R550A. Although it is by far the most affordable ($2100), the colors and picture quality are simply inferior to the others above.<br />We are also probably going to eliminate the Panasonic plasma for whatever reason, the 3d was not amazing, and it's only a 65"" screen.<br /><br />If you mention the name VIZIO to me, I will start getting cold sweats. Although the Vizio M series affords plenty of great reviews, I still have a psychological barrier towards stereotypical cheaper brands. Quite frankly, I also have a barriers towards Kia and Hyundai, although they are great cars.<br /><br />I have had plenty of time to observe the vizio M801d-A3 and the Vizio M701d-A3 in action. Despite my mistrust in the brand, the picture both in 2d and 3d is excellent. Many reviewers  have said that the screen is too reflective and that there are problems operating the remote control on these models though. The screen on the Samsung 75"" Series 7 LED HDTV - UN75F7100, is also just as reflective. The color representation and picture quality of the Samsung is superior to the Vizio though.<br /><br />Anyone who is considering the purchase of a Sharp Aquos should definitely compare/study Vizio M models as well. Personally, I would buy the Vizio over the Sharps, I prefer the Vizios image over the Sharps, and the Sharp 80"" is very expensive too compared to Vizio. If anyone here is considering a Samsung 7100 or 8000 LED, do not even bother checking out the Vizios or the Sharp models.<br /><br />I hesitated a long time Over the Samsung models, and when my research was over, I invited my wife to review the results.<br />The 3 models we studied were the Samsung 4k ultra @ 65"" and both the UN75F7100 and UNF8000 both at 75"".<br /><br />I saw very little picture quality difference between the UN75F7100 and UNF8000, however the 8000 series is much more expensive. For this reason we eliminated it.<br />My wife and I have Apple Tv at home, so we are less interested in Apps and gaming. We like watching movies both in 2d and 3d.<br /><br />Next we compared the 4K ultra Tv's, the sony Xbr and the Samsung 4k. Both have a 65"" screen.<br />For some odd reason we did not find the Samsung 4k impressive. We played a few Sony Demos on it as well as watched a few 3d movies on it, and It was marginally better than the Samsung UN75F7100. Also the 4k is more expensive by $2000.<br />The 3d movies we watched were nearly just as good on the UN75F7100. We also found that the UN75F7100 had better COLOR REPRESENTATION...wait let me explain !!!<br /><br />The sony XBR 4K.<br />If money were no object, I would buy the 85"" model of the Sony XBR 4 K ULTRA, right now.<br />The sony XBR is by far the best picture quality and especially COLOR representation we have seen. By far!!!<br />If you do not believe me, get a few 2d~3d movies you guys like, and go and force the sales people to play them on the Sony.<br />Sony is reluctant to allow third party content to play on their demo Tv's because they want to show you their demo stuff (that looks exceptional BTW. But if you are going to spend 5k on a TV it's your right to be anally retentive.<br /><br />The picture quality, the perfection of color, and the passive 3d blew us away. This tv does an amazing job at up scaling content to a higher a definition of clarity and color.<br />For me, the difference between the Sony and most of the other Tv's was like creating a picture in Photoshop at 72 pixels per inch and then creating the same picture at 300ppi, then comparing the two. Forget the fact that there is little to no real 4k content yet. This tv has by far the best picture.<br /><br />The huge dilemma we now have is. Which of these two tv's are we going to buy? The samsung UN75F7100 or the Sony 4K. The samsung is much larger +10"", but the Sony is better quality in picture and color.<br />We found that the samsung UN75F7100 was not far behind in color, but there was still a visible difference. The sony image is much crisper/clearer. A higher definition, no doubt.<br />The samsung screen is much like the vizio, extremely reflective to any object that may be in front of it.<br />We preferred the sony's screen.<br /><br />Another dilemma we have is that we view tv from 12 feet away, so logically the 75"" samsung would be a better choice. Price wise they are more or less the same given a few hundred dollars.<br />We did find the Samsungs stand quite unpractical. Due to the relatively long TV one needs two small tables at either end of the tv. We cannot wall mount it.<br />The speakers are no doubt better on the sony which has speakers on either side of the screen. Anyhow, all these tv's warrant an added sound bar, so who cares about the original factory sound?<br />Sony is coming out with the same tv in a few weeks without the speakers, So i may wait until I finally decide which of these two to purchase.<br /><br />Hope this review helps you guys choose a tv.",neutral,positive

How did something so obviously damaged leave the warehouse?

My concern is the strength of the material of the bag - it may not be too great - maybe too thin.

"I do a lot of backpacking and need a steady source of power for my cellphone and vaporizer. Recently I put this thing to the test on a 7 day trip. In fact I just got home last night. My whole week was damp and rainy, although I kept my powerbank stored in a ziplock bag I know it was exposed to some condensation which had no affect on it, I dropped it 3 times the cover is battered a little but had no affect on it's ability to function. In the past I've purchased higher end powerbanks that were heavier, had less battery power, rugged and waterproof. Apparently I wasted my money this one held up just fine for my needs. Now my complaint is my vaporizer and cellphone have batteries with a 3500 Mah capacity. On average I would use 15-25% of my cellphone power and half or less of my vaporizer daily. That's 2150 Mah AT MOST daily. Halfway in to day 4 I was already down to 33% power. Meaning I used 8600 to 9000 Mah daily. I should have had 60% or more power remaining. This leads me to question weither this is a true 20800 Mah powerbank. I've had an Anker 12000 Mah battery get me through a week of charging my cell with the same useage as described above and was only halfway drained. This product has dropped a lot in price since I purchased it. Asthetically there are better powerbanks that offer the same amount of power with in the same price range that appear to be better, this one does appeaf to look very cheap. However for the price you get your moneys worth.",neutral,positive

"When the A1 was released, all I read were rave reviews from photographers who received free gear as well as free trips around the world from Profoto. While they weren't explicitly asked to leave a review, and while they were not told to only say nice things about the new flash, nobody wants to upset the company that is giving them free gear and travel.<br /><br />Here's an honest review from a photographer who has no connection whatsoever to Profoto. I own several A1 units, all of which I purchased. I did not receive them for free, am not endorsed by Profoto in any capacity, which will become clear very soon.<br /><br />Anybody looking into the A1 is probably deciding between a Canon/Nikon flash ($250-$600) or a flash made by a brand like Godox/Flashpoint/etc. ($100-$200). The A1 is $1,000.<br /><br />I'm sure you've all ready the positive stuff, so I won't go into too much detail about it. The interface is nice and I much prefer it to any other speedlite interface. The quality of light is good, but most of us aren't shooting speedlites direct at our subjects anyway, so it doesn't matter so much if you're bouncing the light or shooting it through a modifier.<br /><br />Let me get right to the bad. The bad on this flash is so bad that I can't believe that none of the reviews that came out by all of the Profoto sponsored photographers even mentioned it.<br /><br />The craziest thing about this flash, in my mind, is that if you shoot weddings with two bodies, and have a flash on each body, there is no way to set the on camera flashes to ""master"" or ""slave"" so that they can both trigger off camera flashes without triggering each other. That means you have to turn off the on camera flash on the camera you're not currently using so that you don't trigger it. Profoto says they are working on a fix for this, but the fact that they rolled out this flash quite some time ago and still haven't figured it out says something about their R&D. Godox has no problem with this, nor does Canon, Nikon, Flashpoint, Yungnuo, or any of the others.<br /><br />The A1 also doesn't show the actual power level of the off camera flashes, while Godox does. The Godox will show you on your on-camera flash exactly the power level of all your off camera flashes. The A1 lets you adjust the power up and down from the on-camera unit, but won't show you the actual power level. If you want to know the actual level, you have to actually look at each off-camera flash. If they're high up on stands, you'll have to lower them.<br /><br />The first thing my second shooter said when he picked up my A1 was, ""The build quality is crappy."" and I can't disagree with him. These flashes are made in China, just like Godox, and there is some movement to the head. It doesn't stay tight in any position. If a modifier is too heavy, the head can't hold it. A sub-$100 Godox unit really does feel more solid and rugged than the $1,000 A1.<br /><br />As I'm sure you know, the modifier system is absolute garbage. Wedding photography is fast paced and, particularly during reception shooting, involves people bumping into us on the dance floor and things like that. We often swap out our gear in a dark corner and are in a rush to get back to it.<br /><br />The magnetic modifier system doesn't hold together. The bounce card is completely unusable. With such a pretty and well designed flash, it stinks to be walking around with gaff tape all over it, holding everything together. Even then, it doesn't hold. If you get this flash, don't expect to ever use the bounce card during a wedding. It's laughable.<br /><br />The gel system is even worse than the bounce card. They give you two metal rings, which clip together with a magnet, and the plastic gel goes between those two pieces. They don't stay together. If you put the gel onto your flash and then the dome modifier over that, if the dome falls off, the top ring of the gel system comes off with it, then your gel goes flying onto the dance floor. If you lose that one little metal ring, you'll be paying $100 to buy a new gel kit. I lost that ring on my first day shooting with it.<br /><br />All in all I have a love/hate relationship with these flashes. Truth be told, I really regret getting them, and based on the fact that Profoto lowered the price on the duo kit already, I think that sales probably aren't that great. They will need to release an A1x fairly soon to rectify these issues, which I find to be upsetting because when I bought them, I had no idea they had such glaringly embarrassing issues.<br /><br />I'll be selling mine in the near future so that I can consider buying the updated version when it comes out, because once it does come out, the original A1's will be selling on eBay for very low prices.<br /><br />Also, Profoto, quit it with your pricing. I don't complain about $2,000 monolights or $1,000 speedlites, but the $100 gel kit and $100 grid kit is just taking advantage of your customers. Charge big money where big money is due. It costs a lot to design a nice monolight. I get that. But $100 for the crappy gel kit is just unethical. I could never live with myself if I treated my clients with the same amount of disrespect with which you treat your customers. We're hard working professionals trying to make ends meet in an increasingly small and competitive market. Once we invest in your system, stop objectifying us. We're not just wallets. We're people.",negative,negative

"This computer is cheap and powerful.  You can't have both without a catch, and the catch is:<br />This is really a desktop CPU.  Intel tried to discourage Toshiba from doing this, but Toshiba did it any way.<br />What's inside?  How about a desktop P4 built on their 130nm process and based on the ""Northwood"" core.  This core is smaller and cooler than the original P4 (based on the ""Willamette"" core) but it runs at a higher voltage than a true P4M (M for Mobile of course) which means it runs hotter.  To deal with this heat Toshiba has a fan, which drains power from the battery, so you need to plug it in more.  Because the Northwood core has pretty advanced thermal controls built in, your CPU won't run as hot as older Intel or current AMD CPUs, but it will get a little warm.  And unlike another CPU on the market the internal sub-circuitry on the chip will shut off just about everything not being used, which saves a surprising amount of power.<br />Through market studies, Toshiba discovered that many people do this anyway.  And since a desktop CPU cost *less* than a mobile CPU they could under cut the competition by using their engineering muscle to develop a cooling system that could handle a desktop CPU in a notebook.<br />Because the CPU is hotter, Toshiba uses slower, cooler SDRAM instead of faster, hotter DDRAM.  This isn't a big deal for most notebook users but if you are a power users who wants to actually do some CAD on your laptop, you need to look at faster systems.<br />The graphics sub-system is adequate for most games, but you won't want to try playing the latest 3D games on it.<br />It doesn't have USB 2.0, but USB 2.0 PC Cards are pretty cheap these days and easy to install.<br />I think the build quality is decent, but I *always* suggest going into a couple of stores and trying the different brands out first.  There are little things that will sell one over another.<br />I personally prefer the HP Pavilion xt125 Notebook over this computer.  I cost about the same, uses a (slightly) slower, cooler, mobile Celeron (P4 variant) CPU, but faster DDRAM.  All in all the performance is about the same with more battery life.  It also has a better graphics sub-system that can handle a fair bit of 3D gaming and a CDRW drive.  I think the build quality on the HP is better too.",neutral,positive

"I was sick and tired of broken Apple Magic Trackpads when I ordered this. As a partial quadriplegic my right hand often shakes a bit. Apple Trackpads are made of glass under a layer of plastic. When they hit the floor the glass often fractures. Don't tell me to glue it down. For a variety of reasons that's not a viable solution for me.<br /><br />So after my last trackpad broke, I broke down and bought an old friend – the Kensington Expert Trackball. It works precisely as advertised. The trackball is fast, accurate, and very controllable. It's only failing is the rather ugly add-on wrist support. Besides being ugly, it's not very durable in my environment.<br /><br />So, why can't I love this? It's just that the Apple Magic Trackpad is so much better than any mouse or trackball. The cursor can fly across my 27 inch screen with aplomb, landing precisely where I desire. To touch is to click, to touch twice is to right-click. Beyond this there are a dozen or so gestures available to the trackpad. The very nice button set up on the Kensington trackball seems impressive at first glance. I have large hands, but even so the forward buttons are out of normal reach, whether or not I use the wrist support. It's also devilishly easy to accidentally hit the rear most two buttons. The unit includes a scroll ring (half of a job 'n shuttle to the audio/video editors the audience) that is also devilishly easy to hit accidentally, but is devilishly difficult to actually use, at least you someone with fingers my size – large but not excessively so.<br /><br />So, this trackball that I would so love to love stays in a drawer most of the time, coming out only when my trackpad is broken and I am awaiting replacement. Every time it comes out I fall into the same love-hate relationship.",neutral,negative

"Our video baby monitor just crapped out on us so we thought a Dropcam would be a good replacement. Our reasoning was that when we no longer needed to spy on our child, we'd be able to use it as a security monitor.<br /><br />Well, as a baby monitor, this was a bust for us. The lag on the camera was completely unacceptable: typically, it was around 10 seconds, sometimes more. I tried moving it closer to my router which did not improve things enough. The camera also lost connection on a regular basis. I did not try the audio function as it was not something that we were interested in.<br /><br />I read a few reviews from others who bought an audio only monitor to supplement the alert function of the camera. If I'm spending $200 on a camera, I'm not going to spend another $30 or $40 for another monitor just to make everything work as it should.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because I think Dropcam would be a pretty good security monitor, as the lag issue wouldn't be as problematic.",neutral,positive

"I wish I could give the Fire 7 Tablet a 5 star rating, but I cannot not.This version does not live up to the older, original version at all.<br /><br />This Fire 7 replaces my Kindle, one of the early and very well done products. I've had that Kindle for 7-8 years and loved it. While the weight was less than ideal, it was never horrible. Until the last few months that Kindle was a workhorse when it's age began to show: harder to get it to highlight, load, or at times, see pages. Up until then it was an amazing product, well used, and loved. This new Fire 7 does not live up to that in the slightest and I'm sure it will be replaced in less time. This is supposed to be an enjoyable product, that I spent money for plus books, and not a headache to use. They get you hooked - original Kindle purchase, subsequent books - and you cannot leave. Apparently Amazon then no longer feels it needs to offer as good an overall product: you're too far invested to leave. In the end I will keep and use this product. That said, I have had an easier time using my iPhone to read Kindle since the end of life for my previous Kindle. I will use this Fire 7, but at replacement time I might look to other versions (iPhone, iPad, others) to serve in place of the Kindle/Fire product line. That's to be decided in the future. For now, I am providing cons and pros for the Fire 7.<br /><br />First, the cons.<br />I chose to go with the cheaper version - not realizing at first it included ads, then when I &#34;got it&#34; decided to stick with the choice when ordering. How bad could it be? I wish now I'd spent the extra $20. It can be and is bad.<br /><br />The numbers of ads that pop up have grown to be obnoxious. It angers me that I'd already paid for a product or I'd have to pay &#34;extra&#34; to get the same product only minus the ads. Really, that $20 difference makes up for the number of ads and their revenue? How then can Amazon justify the price difference for ads vs non-ads? This does not make sense beyond a way for a passive income for Amazon.<br /><br />I highly recommend paying the extra and saving yourself the &#34;frustration.&#34; I will next time. That's how they get you. It also puts another mark in the pro column a different platform (iPhone) with the Kindle app.<br /><br />Loading is slow. I cannot believe that in this day and age a product that has had a decade to get better has in fact gotten worse. My previous Kindle loaded well, fast, and reliably. This Kindle/Fire 7 takes 4X as long. It's shameful. That includes books, apps, or anything I've used it for so far. I only used my previous Kindle for books other than one trip I'd downloaded a couple TV shows. I highly doubt I would ever use this Fire 7 to do the same. If it takes this long to load a book I can only imagine the length on a movie or TV show! I have added one app: a puzzle app. Perhaps it's the app itself, but if books take so long to load I have to think both at least play a role. The app not only takes time to load to open, but when I attempt to load a puzzle (I only use the free ones within the app) it can take more than a half a dozen times to get the individual puzzle to load. Sometimes it won't load at all and at that point I will do another puzzle or leave the app.<br /><br />Cons within the books:<br />Beyond taking time to load, the the touch function is very touchy, but also not touchy enough. It can take multiple times to get the highlight to take. I'll attempt to use the highlights and it won't take the words I want or take too many other words I never touched. This is one of the issues my previous Kindle had at the end of its life and a main reason I replaced it. Now the newer version does this as well. Why?<br /><br />On the other hand I can touch &#34;near&#34; the corner where bookmarks show and it'll come on - I have not wanted to apply a bookmark - then take many, many, many times to remove. I've ended up leaving some bookmarks much to my annoyance. Then when I want a bookmark it can take as many times or I end up highlighting instead when it won't take. I only had similar issues with my previous Kindle in the last 6 months.<br /><br />The touch issues include page turning, moving into another view, or coming out of these options. Sometimes it wants a harder touch, sometimes softer, sometimes many times, sometimes you bump and it does something you didn't intend. Again, these are glitches and issues that should not be happening at this point in the history of these products.<br /><br />Almost every time I have touched the screen to do something within a book it takes multiple times for the action to occur. This is not acceptable on a product that has been around this long. It is not associated with the pressure: this occurs at multiple levels of touch.<br /><br />I did not get this for it's video or streaming capabilities, though being able to use it as such is nice. To that end, the speakers are ok. I've seen others talk about the ability to hear and quality. This is not a speaker-focused product. Yes, you can hear, it's clear, it's functional, but if you want great sound why are you getting a Fire/Kindle?<br /><br />Alexia it Out<br />We did not have any interest in including Alexa - we are not planning on having that kind of device in our home. But it came with this Fire 7. We therefore gave it a try, set her up, made sure she was &#34;operational,&#34; and attempted to use her. She never responded. Not once. We each tried her. We each checked all the on and off and use buttons, switches, and options. Nothing got Alexa to work. It was a sign we were right in the first place. We turned her off and have no plans to ever invite her back.<br /><br />Pros:<br />There is a decent look, picture/view of the main page(s) and books. Clean, easy to read. It offers more options than my previous Kindle as far as what you can see and where you can see them. You can move &#34;easier&#34; through the various pages and options than my previous version which was more stacked than swiping.<br /><br />This version is much lighter. In general the previous version was not bad, however when wanting to hold it while in the tub, reclining, laying in bed, or anything more relaxed than in your lap it would grow tiring quicker. This new version is lighter, even with the cover. I like the size.<br /><br />I can use the video and streaming. While I have not yet used the Fire 7 for TV or film viewing I can if wanted. The sound is decent/fine (see above). I have watched a few videos for work and pleasure and they've had a nice appearance, clear, and sound was fine. If I wanted to watch something for it's appearance and sound quality I would not first reach for a Kindle/Fire, so as-is function is fine.<br /><br />In conclusion I will keep this Fire 7 and use it. I will put it through the same paces I did with my previous Kindle, but at this point know I will not get the same quality. This is frustrating. I cannot understand how with more time, R&D, and technological advances Amazon has created an inferior product. To that end I know now that I will be less likely to replace this one with another Kindle/Fire product. I will remain open as technology is always changing. But as of right now a door has opened to change that prior to owning this, I wouldn't have expected.<br /><br />Get this Fire 7 if you want something basic and few expectations. Otherwise, consider looking at your other options.",neutral,positive

"I have been using this to clean both of my tablets.  It works fine, but seems like a complete overkill and a little expensive.

"I bought this knowing full well it was just a sticker to dress up the kindle. I wouldn't recommend this to perfectionists. I wouldn't call myself a perfectionist, but with artistic type of things I suppose I am....<br /><br />The back went on perfectly, and fit perfectly. The margins even around edges. Not too wide or small.<br /><br />The front however was a mess. Maybe it was just mine, but the front was crooked. In order to line it up around the letters and have even margins at the bottom the top was crooked, causing overlap over the page buttons on the right side, and to line up the top evenly the bottom was crooked. I would've had to try and stretch it to get it evenly around the letters, which I decided not to do for fear of ripping one of the thin borders around the letters.<br /><br />I was able to get it even by making a small crease on the one side, and smoothing it down. But... it became distracting over time,causing a bubble underneath so I ended up taking it off entirely. Love the way it looks on the back though I use a cover and it's not visible. So it's unfortunate that it was basically wasted. I would try again with a different brand if it didn't cost so much.",negative,positive

"Like some other people I'm only getting around to a review after about 7 years of steady use.<br /><br />This has been my work mouse and it has seen a very steady stream of use over the last several years.  I used it so much I've worn the feet off it and the contacts have been scraped down to the point it won't charge anymore.  Actually I've had charging problems with the mouse for the last few years.  I've always been able to clean the contacts, or jiggle the mouse, etc and get to to charge again.<br /><br />The mouse itself still works fine but it won't charge even new rechargeable batteries anymore.  I'm not complaining too much because I certainly got good service from this mouse.  But the whole recharging feature was kinda messed up from the start and that is what finally killed it.  I don't even think they sell this mouse new anymore but given the problems I had with recharging I would not recommend buying it used.",neutral,negative

"I looked at several Harmony remotes, narrowed down my selection to the Harmony one or the 700.  The 700 fit my requirements nicely so I opted for it over the One with a substantial cost savings.  The build quality is excellent, and the remote is very balanced in the hand.  The included rechargeable batteries are a nice touch along with the included USB wall adapter.<br /><br />The only issues I had with the remote is programming, Logitech seems to be pushing Myharmony.com as the sole programming source, there is not other drivers included with the remote.  One issue I found with Myharmony.com:<br /><br />1) At the time of this writing you cannot add favorite icons from (iconharmony.com and or/etc), seems there are some compatibility issues that Logitech is aware of and was told they are working on correcting it.  The only option to do this is to use the 7.7 Software which has to be downloaded from Logitech's site which is substantially more powerful but less user friendly than Myharmony.com.  Some users might be overwhelmed by the software versions options.  It does indeed work for programming fav. icons.<br /><br />2) Sometimes when pressing a favorite button, the incorrect channel will come up, this is hit or miss, I found that by pressing the button firmly will allow it to correctly enter in the channel.  Often after programming it may be necessary to adjust the speed which can be done via the 7.7 software or via Logitech Customer Support who will tweak the settings so they are transparent if you use Myharmony.com.<br /><br />Logitech Customer Support has been excellent and I have no complaints.<br /><br />I highly recommend this remote it has cleaned up the clutter on my coffee table and made navigating the endless list of channels and devices a breeze.",positive,positive

"I picked this up from my local Frys to pair with my i7 quad core HP Envy 15.6"" laptop.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Size - The size is perfect for my laptop<br />- Front bumpers to secure the front of the laptop (no sliding off).  Can be folded down into stand if not needed<br />- Rear legs to raise the height (2 levels).  Can fold them into the case if you don't need them<br />- Adjustable Fan speed dial<br />- Ability to turn off blue LED<br />- 2 140mm fans<br />- Fairly quiet at lowest speed setting, but not completely silent<br />- Looks nice<br />- USB powered<br />- 1 free USB port to make use of the one you lost powering this<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Fans hit the power cables (inside the case) when weight is put on the surface (i.e. laptop).  Needs a mod to fix<br />- All plastic - For the price, you can't expect a lot.  However, a metal grill would be nice for those with aluminum case laptops<br />- Not completely silent<br /><br />If it weren't for the fan mod I had to do, I would have given this 4 stars because I really like it now that I fixed the problem.  Thermaltake ran the power cables under each fan in a plastic channel that sticks up several millimeters.  Since the case is all plastic, it bows when you put weight on it.  In retrospect, this may only be an issue for those that use the rear legs because it gives the body more of a change to bow under weight.  My laptop is about 5.5 lbs, so it's by no means a massive beast of a laptop.  I ended up having to take the cooler apart and drill holes at the base of each fan to run the cables outside of the case along the bottom several inches and then two more holes to run the cables back in once they cleared the fans.  I also used needle nose pliers to remove (break off) the little plastic channels under each fan the power cables used previously.  These are what the fans would hit and are there to protect the cables.  If the body was less prone to flexing, this would not be an issue.<br /><br />If you don't plan on using the rear legs to put the case at an angle, this is a pretty good case for the price.  If you want to use the legs, it's still a good case if you don't mind modding it some to fix the design flaw.",neutral,positive

"For $32 on Amazon, the product was shipped in a highly impressive packaging (shown in photos compared to iPad side by side).

It also includes space to store the small pencil adapter. Keyboard is ultra light weight, and detachable from cover. It is a benefit when you just want to view the iPad without keyboard. The cover feels high quality when iPad is enclosed in, and it shuts off the power automatically.<br />Cons: The cover is relatively heavy because of the magnets in it. This is the single reason that I struggle if I want to return the product, and not give it a 5-star rating. Also, it is lacking a support position to use pencil to write on iPad with a 20-25 degree flat angle.",neutral,positive

"I gave these pads a try with my Sony MDR-7506's, and it only took about a minute to realize that they weren't going to work out for me.  To say these pads had a drastic effect on the sound curve of the 7506's would be putting it mildly.  I'm going to bring my MDR-V6's home from work, put these pads on them, and do some side by side comparison testing (I expect a very similar result).  I wouldn't have a problem with the accentuated bass or even attenuated treble, but again, the curve was all off and the 7506's incredibly flat response was destroyed.  Even the sound-stage felt all wrong; voices and instruments on my reference/evaluation tracks were all in the wrong places.  If anyone is interested, I will try to update this review with my findings.  I may also toss these on my ATH-m50's to see what they do to them, but for now I can only speak to the results when using these with the Sonys<br /><br />My listening setup includes my Chromebook Pixel LS for digital files (320kbps or better), an Onkyo C-7030 CD player, a Schiit Modi 2 Uber DAC, and a Schiit Asgard 2 headphone amplifier.  I also use my Little Dot MK2 MKII tube amp for certain types of listening.  My headphone stable includes AKG Q701’s, Sony MDR-V6’s and MDR-7506’s, Audio Technica ATH m50’s, V-Moda Crossfade LP’s and M100’s, Beyerdynamics DT-880 Premiums 250 ohm, Sennheiser HD-598’s, HD-600’s, HD-239’s, and PX-100 ii, and some Koss Porta Pro’s.  I’ve tried Grado SR 80’s and SR 225’s (just too darn uncomfortable), the Beyerdynamics DT 990 Pro 250 ohm, HiFi Man HE-400’s, just to name a few, and my son even owns a pair of Beats Solo phones that I’ve messed with (Yuk).  I don’t use any hardware or software equalizer at any point in my signal path as I believe that great headphones speak for themselves.<br /><br />My star rating is based on scoring these pads a 5 for comfort and a 1 for adverse effect on the quality of the sound of the MDR-7506's.<br /><br />I suggest reading the top review for these pads and spending some time listening to your headphones with some of your favorite tracks.  After this, you'll know how to do the changeover quickly enough that changes to the sound should be obvious when you replay those favorite tracks with the new pads in place.",neutral,positive

"Actually TRYLY AMAZED. I had purchased a 3 piece bundle of Range extenders at 3 times the total cost of the HYZOM. They worked intermittently and had to be Reset almost daily. After a week I sent them back and tried 1 of the HYZON's and another brand similar to this unit. The HYZON and I use it in Bridge Mode worked FLAWLESSLY, while the other similar unit had about half the range and was noticeably slower in transmitting speed. To Connect the HYZON take less than 2 minutes. I now have 3 of these HYZOM Extenders and have NO BUFFERING WIFI/Internet for almost 7200sqft and one in in my 30x50 Aluminum Work Shop over 100 feet from the main WIFI Router and has to go through 3 walls and the external wall of my home is Brick, across the large Patio area through the aluminum siding to get to the Extender.<br /><br /> I tried HYZON in Repeater Mode and is was not as fast nor had the Range of Bridge Mode why I do not know. I do have 1 in Router Mode and so far it works just fine so Ill leave it like that for now. GREAT Bang for the Small Dollar these cost versus the Multi have to plug in and find a space for units.

The info. on Amazon shows this being sold together with the Explorist 710. I have the 710 and the cradle included with this mount is way to narrow for the 710 (and probably the 510 and 610). I will have to buy a different Ram cradle if I want to use the mount piece. The mount looks OK but I haven't tried snapping it over bike handle bars (I'm waiting on a new bike that I bought this for). I only hope it doesn't brake. It will have to stretch open pretty far to snap over the handle bar. The instructions say to do it this way. We'll see. The only other way would be to to remove the brake handle and shifter and slip it on the bar. On a road bike this would be a pain. I'll update later after I've tried installing it.,negative,positive

"I installed the Onkyo dongle into our new TX NR 709 receiver (receiver very nice so far).  After manually entering network access information, it connected with a signal strength of 45 percent and enabled us to log in and listen to multiple internet radio sources.  We did experience considerable break-ups due to buffering (typical internet download speeds to a wireless laptop range between 20 - 25 MB/s so the ISP isn't to blame).  Also had to do occasional resets to reacquire the router's signal.<br /><br />More recently, I used a powerline adapter to redeploy an aging Belkin Pre-N router as an access point within 15 feet of the receiver.  This boosted signal strength to 90 - 100%.  Break-ups due to buffering were greatly reduced.  Still had to do periodic resets to maintain connectivity.<br /><br />Early this week, the dongle totally died.  It could not find any WiFi access points.  After verifying that the receiver's USB port still worked (with my iPod) and discussing options with Onkyo, we determined that the dongle had died (common according to Onkyo).  It was also out of warranty.<br /><br />With the access point within 15 feet of the receiver, I opted to connect it to the internet via an Ethernet cable.  That solution worked immediately.",negative,positive

"Great idea but it doesn't really work very well. I thought of giving this 1 star but then thought, if someone hasn't tried something else, this might work for them. Not for me though.<br /><br />I love the concept of the whole 360 spin thing because it makes flash positioning so versatile. This would be so much easier to use than other bounce modifiers. But in practice, it mostly fails as a flash modifier. First, using this to bounce a flash, from even a few feet to a wall and back a few feet to a subject, it seems that even the clear globe cuts out too much of the light and you can pretty much forget the opaque and the 1/2 thing. Then, if you use it straight toward a subject (say for a portrait shot) though it sends most of the light up to bounce and a little forward, it doesn't do it well. AND, the worst thing, which is why I am returning it, is that, due I guess to being a short (even with the 6&#34; card) modifier, and the base being pretty wide around your flash head, it really cuts an abrupt line across the bottom of the subject. You almost need to shoot from a bit above a person and aim down a little so that the flash is tilted down and isn't cut off at the bottom. But, doing that, you then can mess up the bounce angle.<br /><br />Maybe I'm spoiled because I have been using Flashbenders. Even the large is a bit cumbersome used on camera but it sure does a great job of bouncing AND sending beautiful, full, even light where it needs to go. I've tried a MagMod setup, other card things similar to the Flashbenders, and other options. I guess I sound like an ad but, forget this, try Flashbenders, and learn to deal with the fact that, though a bit harder to deal with, what they do is worth the effort.",negative,positive

"I was able to verify that these worked by connecting them to my iPhone very easily. Once I knew they worked, I was very disappointed with the sound quality. The JBL system I had in my Prius some years ago was hands down the best and clearest sounding car stereo I’ve ever  had. That was what I wanted and why I selected JBL. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.<br /><br />The sound is very thin and reedy. There’s hardly any bass. I adjusted the EQ in my iPhone to Increase Bass, and also tried several other settings in hopes that would remedy the problem, but it didn’t. My AirPods sound far better.<br /><br />Once I verified that they worked, I instructed my phone to forget them and reset them to factory settings. I had to await arrival of a Bluetooth transmitter - my tv is a smart tv, but apparently only works with Wi-Fi and not Bluetooth. I purchased a Trond V5.0 transmitter. No matter what I did, I could not get the ear buds to pair with the Trond. But then came the final nail in the coffin.<br /><br />I read on a different website (I purchased these on Amazon and lines at the description closely). On the Best Buy website, someone asked about connection to a tv because they also had connectivity issues. There, JBL told the customer that these earbuds are not recommended for tv - and that was why I purchased them in the first place. If they aren’t suitable for tv, why not mention that, like, ANYWHERE in the description?<br /><br />Bottom line is, if these earbuds are only useful for listening to music, I think you could get a less expensive pair that would sound better. They do seem like they are good quality, but I would much rather just stick with AirPods for music. And I’ll have to get something different for tv, because apparently, these are not low latency enough, even though the description does say they use AptX Low Latency.",neutral,positive

TWC noted this was all fine and no other devices have an issue.<br /><br />While it is very tempting to buy a 6 tuner card that is billed as working with your cable company, it is not worth it. Under obvious hardware issues, Ceton will not honor their warranty. I'm out $250. Don't be any sucker like me.",negative,positive

"Couldn't be happier with this purchase!  I have used many portable speakers in the past, and I can say that this one is by far the best, not only in its price range, but when compared to speakers that are considerably more expensive.  Does it sound better than anything on the market?  Of course not, but for $30, it just can't be beat.  Sound is surprisingly rich, and the volume is pretty high-- I rarely have any reason to turn it up all the way.  For a speaker with such a small form-factor, it has a vast array of options.  You can fill up a flash drive or SD card with music and you're good to go!  Plus, the battery is easily accessible, so you can buy an extra one to take along in case you won't be able to plug it into a power source.  Best of all, you can actually charge your portable device via the built-in USB port-- who needs a 40-pin iPod/iPhone dock when you can use a 3.5mm headphone jack and a USB charging cable?  I guess you could spend $150 on a fancy speaker with bluetooth and a direct dock, but audio-over-bluetooth is never going to sound as good as a direct 3.5mm connection, and it's going to cost considerably more.  Build quality is solid as well-- I've packed this thing in my suitcase and sent it around the world and it still looks brand-new.  Battery life is great too (never timed it, but it lasts many hours on a single charge).  Like all rechargeable batteries, the length of the charge diminishes with use, but replacement batteries are cheap and easy to swap out.  I just can't say enough good things about this product.  For thirty bucks, you've got nothing to lose!",positive,positive
"I have had the Kindle 2 and the Kindle 3 now. The Kindle 3 has some significant upgrades that really make it a lot easier to use.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. The smaller frame makes it much more compact for carrying around, and the reconfiguration of the buttons is nicely done, especially the scroll buttons.<br />2. The reader is great in the sun and easy to read with no glare<br />3. The wifi works fabulous, even with network keys, etc. that you have to type in to connect, Amazon made this easy to configure<br />4. The 3G is my backup for when I'm traveling, but honestly I really don't need it, and nor should you unless you REALLY have to have that book right that instant when you're on the road. In my experience this is rarely the case.  It's nice to have for hitting up wikitravel when you're on the road and don't have internet access.<br />5. Amazon has a wealth of books to buy online. They improved their online store interface a bit too, which I like because before when you hit back, it was a mystery where you'd end up.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. I am not a fan of the inline keyboard, because I'm used to typing on more a Qwerty interface from the Kindle 2.<br />2. They eliminated the numbers from the keyboard which is a bit of a nuisance.<br />3. The system reboots itself randomly every now and then, and forgets your page. Bookmark often and you can get around this problem. Also fortunately it only takes less than a minute to reboot.  The bad part is that sometimes it can reboot up to 5 or 6 times in a row.  That has really gotten on my nerves when trying to read.  Amazon should have not used Java but it works when it's working...<br />4. The browser is still ""experimental"" which means it comes riddled with bugs.  I have on several occasions tried to read some content (on Day 1 of ownership) and the browser will stay ""stuck"" on the screen. The system locks up way too often when using the browser to the point where I'm afraid to use it.<br />5. You still can't download books from a library with a DRM on it. That's amazon's way of owning their own proprietary book market.  This is frustrating, but there are ways around this that involve installing software on your computer and being clever. Google can help you with that.<br />6. The system locks up often too. Sometimes you have to sit and wait for it to catch up, especially when you're trying to use the browser.<br /><br />Overall I love my Kindle but I had to dock it to 3 stars because of the shoddy operating system. I've only had my Kindle for 3 weeks and it has restarted itself almost every other day if not more.  Also, there once was a time, in my book the Kindle corrupted the text, and force restarted, then told me I needed to delete and re-download my book. That was very frustrating!!!!<br /><br />Amazon needs to have a firmware update and soon. The restarting is so frustrating!",neutral,positive

Overall, this is a nice, affordable option, that can be used on any metallic case.<br />UPDATE: I ordered a second unit to cover my side vents and realized that the actual mesh is fabric and can be torn off the plastic rectangle mold with a little bit of force, so keep this in mind. It's fine if you set it and forget it, but if you are moving and touching the filter frequently, then you might want to go for something else, or just be very careful.",neutral,positive

They are significantly darker than the original white letters on the keyboard.  I would call them a medium gray.

"This is a nice-looking keyboard and mouse and both feel solid and well constructed. I had no problems setting things up and for the first 15 minutes was very pleased with the purchase. I then had problems with a couple of keys not working, most notably the number 1 key and its associated exclamation mark. This is a problem because I do occasionally need the number ""1"" and exclamation point! I also had a problem, for whatever reason, with the keyboard sending a signal to the CPU indicating that the ESC key was pressed. On my system, this has the unfortunate effect of stopping Windows 7 from loading automatically. I went online and followed the suggestions of downloading the most current software and putting in new batteries, but the problem persisted. Microsoft recommends trying it on another computer, but I don't have a second system available for experimentation. I am using Windows 7 on a 64-bit system, not sure if this is a software glitch, but it is a kind of deal breaker for me. I'm having to return. I actually liked the board and mouse. Too bad.",negative,negative

"UPDATED REVIEW:<br />Anker reached out tome after reading my review below, asking for details and offering to send me a replacement for a malfunctioning unit. After reviewing my description, they came to the conclusion that I was just expecting something that doesn't happen. Despite the negative experience being all due to my own incorrect assumptions, Anker still offered to send me a second unit to assist with convenience in listening at my home. Regardless of the fact that their product was functioning 100% properly, they still wanted to help me feel better about the situation and did what they could. Fantastic customer service, impressive PR, and I am now a happily loyal Anker fan.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />If you plan to use your speaker with more than one device, don't purchase this one. In order to move from device to device, you first have to disconnect the last one to utilize the speaker, otherwise the new device won't connect. In other words, you can't just move seamlessly from phone to laptop to iPad, etc. More than once I've had to message my husband at work (well beyond the range of the bluetooth) and ask him to manually disconnect, otherwise I can't use the speaker at home. This is incredibly frustrating and absolutely unnecessary and I hope Anker fixes this issue for its next rendition.",neutral,positive
"I edited this review on 11/16/2012 to go from 5 stars down to 2 stars. This TV of mine died after 2 years of low usage. It started to sputter after changing channels many months ago and it got worse and worse until it sputtered most of the time. You could not enjoy watching any TV show when it sputtered this way. The picture would flicker about every 10 seconds. I ended up throwing it away rather than pay $200 to have it fixed. My neighbor gave me a lightly used Zenith 27"" CRT TV that works very well for me. After my experience I don't plan to buy another LCD TV. There are a lot of cheap CRT TVs for sale on craigslist because of people buying LCD TVs and not wanting their big heavy TV any more. Well, the big heavy TVs are more reliable in my experience. I may have got a lemon, I don't know, but I'm not gong to shell out hundreds more to buy another one.",negative,negative
"It is very protective, but it seems bulkier than it needs to be and the strap, which works as advertised, could have been more refined. It wobbles where it connects to the case, a bit.

"I just received this unit in the mail after getting my iPad Air fourth generation last Thursday from another outlet. I am mediately wrote a review within five minutes because that’s how much I approve of this purchase.<br /><br />I have a long history of using Apple products and always looking for the best case for my iPad. I bought the case for $80 from Apple for my old iPad. I bought multiple online. Sometimes tried them and within two months just buying another because they are cheap, poorly designed, and a pain in the butt to balance on the foldable magnetic cases I have had in the past.<br /><br />Then came this Jewel. It is a little heavier than it is advertised I believe, but not by much. It’s still a lightweight case despite the Herculean effort some of the reviewers supposedly went through.<br /><br />It is sturdy, maneuverable, lightweight, and when you set it up it doesn’t automatically topple down whether you’re setting on a couch, outside, or any other way. I know that everyone here has had the constant struggle of trying to find a flat surface. This seems to do well with that.<br /><br />One other surprisingly good thing that I have never seen:  The area that the case sits in that fits around the outside of the unit is easier to unhinge, and surprisingly easy to pop off despite it having a VERY snug fit.  You do not have to use your bodyweight to put it in place and you definitely do not need that to take it out. I again re-iterate. It will not slip out! However, if you use a reasonable amount of pressure to pop it out it is easy to do.",positive,positive

The pix weren't crisp and clear, and everything seems to have a yellow tinge to it. Plus, the time between pressing the shutter button to when it actually takes the pic is too long. By the time the pic is taken, the people or animals have already moved and your picture is crap.

"Not sure how they came to the conclusion of ""laptop compartment"" of being 17"" X 12.5"" X 2.5"" because that doesn't work for rectangular laptops - width goes down to under 11"" near the top of the 17"", so unless your laptop is missing corners or significantly smaller than 17"", it won't fit inside the laptop compartment<br /><br />Also came with annoying plastic covering the logos on the straps which was sewn into the straps, making it a PITA to remove.<br /><br />Would NOT recommend - if you need at 17"" laptop bag, get something else, and if you don't need a 17"" laptop bag, also get something else",negative,negative

"These are my all-time favorite headphones. I think I'm on my third pair. In terms of fit, I haven't been able to find anything else that stays in my ear the way these do. But like all great things, they have a downside. Notice how I said three pairs? These things break easily. Like, stemmed wine glass easily. I think the longest I've kept a pair is two years, Usually, after anywhere from 6 months to a year, one of the ears will go out. If you don't mind being left with one-sided headphones (I work in an office, so this works for me), you're good to go for a little while longer — but know your days of easy listening are limited.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend these if you're looking for sound quality and fit for a low price point. But don't get your hopes up that you've found your forever headphones.",neutral,positive

"Remember, this is just an experience of one person with one camera. If there are a lot of corroborating reviews, then pay attention. In my case this fit the camera, a Canon Rebel XS1. Maybe this wasn't meant to work with this camera? It fit well, but the optics were off. With this extender in place I could not bring the subject, at any distance, into focus (the Rebel has an adjustment to suit the individual eye). Whether I was trying to use it with the naked eyeball or wearing correction (glasses) the view remained blurred no matter what my camera adjustment did, so it had to go back.  With it off my camera view finder is clear to my eye or corrected eye, so it was clearly the addition of this device.

Picked this up to make a retro gaming console. It comes with NOOBS on it and you can easily install Raspbian or Lakka. I found Lakka to be a bit difficult to use and wasn't able to connect my dualshock 4 controllers without some workarounds so I ended up using the included SD card reader to flash a RetroPie image to the SD and now I have a fully functional retro box that allows me to play my roms with my dualshock 4 controllers connected wirelessly.<br /><br />Even with the included fan connected this thing is super quiet and it handles older 2D games with ease. I've seen some stuttering with N64 games but I haven't taken the time to troubleshoot it and see if it can be optimized. I haven't tried many PSX games yet to see how it fairs with those.,positive,positive

"There's so much personal taste involved when assessing headphones. There's always a tradeoff to be made in terms of what headphones have what strengths--but even at that, these headphones are pretty disappointing.<br /><br />These headphones have great depth (boomy) but in midranges they lack a lot of detail. The sound is full but very flat. Crispness is really lacking.  If you've heard some higher-end headphones, or are the sort of person that appreciates high-end satellites and tweeters when listening to a conventional speaker setup, you likely will be profoundly disappointed with these headphones.<br /><br />On the plus side, they are very comfortable to wear. They also do a very good job of sealing the sound in, so people nearby won't hear your music if you're wearing these. So they are a very good choice for work if you can put up with the sound quality.<br /><br />Worth serious consideration instead (for a closed/isolating headphone w/DJ functionality) would be the Sony MDR-V6--which are similar in construction but beat the V600 in every way, or the AKG K81DJ, which also produces far superior sound for the same money.  Those are not quite as comfortable as the Sony's--but sure sound better.",negative,positive

And I do recommend this product. Though I would warn that  if you are someone who depends on diagonal lines being crisp without that in app feature I would suggest you check if the wobble would bother your work flow.

"This Review is for Linux Users<br /><br />This graphics card works in Linux but I don't recommend it. You can't get the full 4GB use out of it no matter what nvidia settings you use in Ubuntu 14.04LTS or CentOS7LTS. You'll get to about 50% before your display stops responding. I have 2 24in monitors, 1 plugged into HDMI the other DVI, an 8 core 3.5Ghz (5Ghz turbo) CPU with 16GB ram and when I'm multitasking with multiple virtual machines and my system slows to a crawl and I check my loads; cpu=good, system-ram=good, graphics=bad. Display response drops to choppy. Further more, none of the nvidia settings provided through the proprietary nvidia drivers for Linux fully support Linux (some settings work, others do nothing).<br /><br />If you're buying this card because you need that 4GB of ram, you won't get it. It's performance is equal with a machine with the same other spec's but 1.8GB ram for graphics. Plus with heavy computing, this card gets very hot. All the major heat from my PC is coming from my graphics card and I'm not even gaming.<br /><br />If you are planning on doing single display, basic computing and light (like minesweeper light) gaming in Linux, this card will do the job.

"I was skeptical about getting a kindle because I love having an actual book in my hand but I'm so so glad I decided to get this.

I was worried about getting headaches with it because sometimes if I stare at a computer screen too long my head hurts but it hasn't happened with my kindle yet. I will say the battery life doesn't seem like it would be able to last a week, I gave it a full charge and after a day of reading it's at 60%. I got the 3 months of kindle unlimited with it and it's so worth it because you get a ton of free books that you ""borrow"" (up to 10 at a time) and you can finish and return them to borrow more.

"This TV measures 48 inches wide by 27 3/4 inches tall. It comes packed with power cord, hardware to mount base stands, terminal covers, and a remote control. The screen is an interesting flat glass pane, that has no border. The actual picture on the screen takes up all but about 1/4 inch around the outside of the screen, so it really has a large look to it. When off, the screen is dark black. The picture is quite remarkable. The colors are unbelievably vivid. The clarity often has almost a 3D look to it. The sound is so cool! It actually comes straight out of the flatness of the screen itself. There are no separate speaker “vents” that I can tell. The remote itself is quite a work of art. When picked up or moved, it automatically backlights. It has voice control and the YouTube, Netflix, Disney+, and Prime Video quick buttons are a nice touch. The setup, connection to Wi-Fi, and functionality is easy. This TV package is quite noticeably the finest television I’ve ever owned.  Made in Mexico.",positive,positive

"These cameras have a good feature set, good compatibility and good picture quality at this price-point.  However, inside the ""vandal proof"" dome (that scuffs quite easily, I'm not sure what vandals it's proof against) the camera is mounted to the housing by screws into three tiny, frail black plastic pillars.  Of the six cameras we ordered, four arrived with all three pillars shattered and the cameras bouncing around loose inside the dome.<br /><br />Note: The Airlive OD-2060HD (this camera) is advertised elsewhere as PTZ, but it is pan/tilt only.  Any ""zoom"" is a function of software.  Fortunately at 1080P it has enough resolution to give that a chance in good light.<br /><br />The rest of the housing is quite high quality, metal with rubber moisture rings at all possible entry points -- bordering on over-engineered.  So it's just a mystery why they would cheap out on such a fundamental and failure-prone component, but it's very disappointing.<br /><br />Naturally the broken four were the ones we only spot-checked, so since they look fine in the box, we didn't spot the issue until installation day at which point we were not in a position to return them.  We were able to work around the issue with epoxy and patience for two of the cameras, but the other two are still giving us trouble; the cameras just kind of lay in the dome and refuse to respond to pan/tilt controls since they aren't attached to the base.<br /><br />Although I gave these three stores for the features and picture quality, I would strongly recommend not using them unless you have the patience to deal with the 2/3rds chance of a broken mount.",neutral,positive

I've been in IT for years, and this is one of the more difficult accessories I've ever had the displeasure of trying to configure.<br /><br />This could very well be the most overrated and overpriced piece of junk that Apple has rolled out yet.

"Update 8/19/17<br />About a year later, we're down to one star from three. Here's why:<br />If you try to use the Tap with video, you get a lag so it makes everything look like a poorly-dubbed bootleg movie. I have tried to use the Tap as a speaker for my Fire HD, laptop, Xbox One, and iPhone. If you are just doing audio, it's fine; in fact, it gives pretty good sound. Just don't expect to use this for anything other than listening to music or podcasts. It's not a supplemental speaker for anything involving video. Also, every time I turn it off, I have to go through the whole setup process when I turn it on again. I guess that's not too bad since I hardly ever use it, right? I wish I could return this but it's way too late now.<br /><br />Here is my original review with other udpates:<br /><br />Don't expect a life-changing experience with this device (or any other consumer electronic device, for that matter). My experience with the Echo raised my expectations so maybe I'm coming in with them a little high.<br /><br />First, the bad:<br />1. This only receives Bluetooth; it doesn't send. I would like to have used this in the office with wireless headphones, rather than draining my phone battery or having it plugged in and charging all the time. I'll have to get an Echo Dot for that.<br />2. The Bluetooth connection is pretty weak or something. I have to crank up the volume on my phone and on the Tap to get it to a listenable level, so when it does its little &#34;beep boops&#34; and when Alexa talks, it's pretty loud.<br />3. Setup required a 15 minute phone call where you first turn off some settings and turn some others on, then go back and turn some others on and some off. I remember doing this with my Echo but I only had to do it once &#60;for the Echo; pretty much EVERY time for the Tap!&#62; so it's not too bad.<br /><br />The good:<br />1. Once it's cranked up, the sound is really good for a bedroom, small living room or, say, a mid-level manager's office. This is my first Bluetooth speaker but I'm fairly picky when it comes to sound. This little thing does a solid job!<br />2. This might sound strange, but it's sorta pleasant to hold. It looks like it would be cold steel but it actually has a nice fabric cover. I don't think I'll go mobile with it, but I'd probably get one of those neat-looking carrying cases if I do. I imagine that without some sort of protective cover the fabric would become less pleasant pretty quickly.<br />3. The 3.5 mm input jack will be a cool way to connect to my Xbox One controller for better audio or if I want to watch a movie without turning on the whole home-theater.&#60;Note: your game won't sync correctly with the audio so this little plan didn't work.&#62;<br /><br />Summary: It's an almost-win. I definitely will not return it &#60;wish I had returned it&#62;, and if I start to take a liking to it I'll update this review. &#60;Updated, even though I don't like it.&#62; Meanwhile, let's see how the Echo Dot does in my office when it shows up next week. &#60;Dot was better.&#62;<br /><br />Update: The Tap doesn't work with the Xbox One wireless controller without an adapter. I bought one for $19 (Afterglow LVL Headset Adapter). Now I can play Xbox audio through the Tap using a 3.5 mm cable. That's pretty much the only way I will use this device, but I'm going to keep it and see if I find any other uses.<br /><br />Another Update: Using the Afterglow LVL Headset Adapter caused the audio to have sync problems with the video, so you'd see something happen and hear about it a second or two later. Of course, this ruins the movie-watching experience and degraded gaming. Unfortunately, Amazon won't let me return the adapter so that's $19 wasted, not to mention I probably won't use the Tap for anything.

I bought this camera to take on vacation. While on the plane the back LCD screen shut off and has never worked since. The processor is so slow you could take a nap waiting to take another photo.

I've actually bought like 3 pairs of these because i love them so much (and occasionally i lose one or it ends up in the laundry). These headphones are a great value for the money and perfect for running or other activities. They are super lightweight and stay in my ear snuggly. I've never had an issue with sweat or rain affecting their performance either. I've bought significantly more expensive wireless headphones and a lot of times they are clunkier and the operation is less intuitive. I think they did a nice job with the simplicity of the gestures which get really confusing when you add voice assitants.,positive,positive

There is a small area (about 2-3 mm) on one edge that is not covered.<br />2. Perhaps more importantly, my Apple Pencil does not work on this protector. The main reason I purchased this product was to protect my iPad's screen from scratches from drawing with my Apple Pencil.<br /><br />I will contact customer service and request a refund. If issued, I'll edit this review.",negative,positive

"I have updated this review because I finally got someone from technical support to help me get the router working properly. It seems to be working fine.  As a result I changed this from two stars to four stars.  I left my first review and then added an updated section at the end.<br /><br />First review:<br /><br />It is rare that I give an item two stars but after two calls to technical support I still can't get the router to work properly. More importantly the people to whom I spoke at technical support seemed like they were not very familiar with the product. One explained he did not get many calls on this specific router. He could not help me get to a setup wizard to make sure the router was properly setup. He did finally help me find a setup page but he seemed unfamiliar with how it was setup.<br /><br />Ultimately the signal strength with this router was poor and the support people have were not able to help me fix the problem. I could call again and wait on hold for 15 to 20 minutes and hope to get someone who can help but I just went back to using my old router.<br /><br />I have used a couple of wireless routers in the past. The ones I have used have had automatic setup wizards that guide the user through the setup process. There was no such automatic guide with this router.<br /><br />The quick setup guide that came with the router was not very helpful to me in setting up the router.  The instructions are in 13 different languages but only have a sentence or two of an explanation for each step.<br /><br />After attaching the router to my modem and my computer I had a hard time figuring out how to get to the point where I would enter the security key. (One technical support person seemed to say there was no security key). The instructions were vague as to how to find where to input the security key. I eventually figured this out on my own but could not figure out where enter the SSID number. More importantly the signal strength on my router was showing as poor.<br /><br />I called up technical support twice.  Both times I got someone who seemed like they were not familiar with the router. The most recent support person indicated he did not get many calls on this router. He could not help me find a setup wizard and after getting me to a setup page he could not tell me where to go to input the SSID code that the quick setup guide seems to indicate is important. He could not figure a way to get the signal strength to read as good or excellent. He really seemed unfamiliar with this router.<br /><br />I could call back and wait on hold and hope to get someone who can help me but it is just easier going back to my old router, which is another brand, which I am using now. The signal strength with that router is excellent.<br /><br />I like all that this router has to offer. I read a glowing review about this router in a computer magazine. I was looking forward to using it.  Perhaps if I had more computer knowledge I could get this to work. Still, I would expect the technical support people to know how to get it working and they could not help me do so. I called technical support twice. It seems unreasonable to do it again. If a router does not come with a setup wizard then it should be easy to setup or tech support should know how to do this.<br /><br />I had to give this two stars because I gave up trying to get it to work because the technical support people to whom I spoke did not seem very familiar with this router and I want a signal strength that is excellent rather than poor. My old router is giving me that right now.<br /><br />Updated Review:<br /><br />I called back Buffalo and found a tech support agent who was able to get my router working with an excellent connection. He did not seem totally familiar with all aspects of the router but we got it working. For instance if you put a number code into the address bar you get to a page where you can perform updates or delete or add a guest account or create a web filter. I had questions about these and the agent was not as familiar with them as I would have liked.<br /><br />In fact, I asked about an update because a reviewer on Amazon noted this should be done to make this work better. I would have expected the tech support agent to suggest this but he did not.<br /><br />Right now my connection speed is excellent.  I have watched a movie using streaming video on my wireless Blu-ray player and it looked fine. My television is a floor below so the signal did have to travel a bit.<br /><br />One of the reasons I wanted to switch routers is because my old one only had a 90 day free support window to ask questions about the router. I was past the 90 day window and my old router did not seem to be working properly and I was told there would be a fee to help. I was told by the tech agents at Buffalo that free phone support last for the three year warranty. I hope that is the case because this would be a big plus.<br /><br />I still think the setup on this should be made easier for people who do not know a lot about routers. Based on three call to Buffalo I am still not happy with some of the technical support agent's knowledge of this product.  Still, this seems to be working fine right now.<br /><br />Final Update:<br /><br />I changed this review to four stars because the router has been working fine for some time now. I use the router with my wireless Blu-ray player to stream video and I am happy with the connection and the quality of the video. It is a shame that my first experiences with technical support started out badly.",positive,positive

"The purpose for my buying this was so that I can have multiple items plugged in at the same time, but what I have found is that I can't use more than two at a time or it  ages the horrible high pitched chirping noise.

been a long time user of Netgear networking product. the quality is good and their speed are as fast as it gets. but their support and drivers are always lacking. anytime you upgrade os or computers expect issues. you only get 90 day support after registering or you have to pay $40 to talk to someone. the forums are lacking and the moderators are arrogant wanting to tell you the issue but not really wanting to explain how to fix it. the driver releases are slow and they blame Microsoft when you call their support line with any issues they have caused updating. eventually they will release a new driver to fix issue but you will have to wait. Having used their products for some time i will state that they make great hardware but you will need to know how to troubleshoot most of your own issues.,neutral,positive

There are no presets, just the option of choosing between AM and FM and using a dial tuner.

"I have mixed opinions:<br />1. The micro-usb to lightning adapter is excellent, only if it works. I had 2 of the adapters : as soon as Apple released iOS 10, the adapters did not work on 2 iPads I just updated. One was in 30 day period and was sent back. Other was replaced free by Homespot. I hope the adapters will continue to work over next updates.<br />2. The 3.3 ft wire has too much resistance OR uses very small AWG wire. When connected to USB voltmeter-ammeter device, this wire does not deliver a good current to devices as compared to other 3.3 wires in the market.<br /><br />On the GOOD side: I suggest you use the adapter with a 20 AWG wire to charge iDevices - the current delivered is even stronger than Apple OEM cable. A part of the credit goes to the Homespot adapter because I have other company adapters and despite using with robust 20 AWG cables, those adapters do not help deliver a strong current. Another good combination is the 5 inch Homespot cable (if you are okay with this short cable) + Homespot adapter - this too delivers good current to iDevices. [Wire is short, less resistance, more current delivered.]",neutral,positive

"The screen protector was easy to install; pretty basic if you've installed a screen protector on a mobile tablet or smartphone. There's a large bubble across the bottom where it didn't seem to adhere. Some other protector brands state you should wait a day or two to let the bubbles settle, so I'll try the same with this and if it hasn't dissipated I'll probably remove and reinstall because I may have attached it slightly too low. Another reviewer mentioned a problem with the edges not being beveled, but they're not beveled on my iPad or iPhone screen protectors and those have no bubbles at all...I'd recommend.<br /><br />Update: This thing didn't even last a year. The corner never laid down. I removed and reapplied but it did not help. And over time it developed weird circles that obscured the view of my screen (see pic), so I removed and trashed it. It also is absolutely not fingerprint resistant. I might reorder and try again; I do not want to leave my screen unprotected but I cannot recommend, either.",neutral,negative

"When I bought my first i-pad years ago, I had also purchased a cover from this company (Fintie) thru Amazon. Can't recall at this time if I had given it a rating but if I did, it would have been 5 stars. At this time the cover still looks almost new without any wear showing in the threads or folds. Very happy with the earlier purchase.<br /><br />Earlier this month I bought a new i-pad and again went to Amazon to find a cover. There were many to choose from but since I was so happy with the earlier cover, I made it a point to stay with this company and order another. (Note I purchased the classic black which has a smooth texture, not a pebble type texture that was on my first one). Upon removing the cover from the cellophane wrap, I found it giving off a petroleum like smell. The smell would transfer to my hands and it felt slightly oily. At this point, I laid out the cover to see if the smell would go away which most of it did after about 5 days. Unfortunately, the cover still had the slightly oily feel to it. I really like the construction of the cover and wanted to keep it. At this point, I made a mild solution of water and Dawn dish soap and wiped down the cover.

"In terms of thermal performance, I have no complaints. The cooler performs on par with other popular coolers at or slightly under this price point. Unlike some other reviewers, I did not have a problem with fan noise. The fans CAN get noisy, of course, but if you install the cooler properly and adjust your fan curves, it should never have to (except maybe under prolonged, artificial, stress-testing loads).<br /><br />My biggest complaints about this cooler are with the installation process and the aesthetics. The included instruction ""manual"" is basically a six-panel comic strip with complicated diagrams that require a 4-year engineering degree to make sense of. To mount the cooler and set up the RGB, I ended up needing to consult online forums and 3rd party Youtube tutorials.<br /><br />Once I did get it installed, the aesthetics were very disappointing to me. The RGB on this cooler has a ""cheap"", uneven look to it. Because the fan blades are transparent, the lighting isn't smoothly diffused like what you see on Corsair products.<br /><br />The ""remote"" that the cooler comes with is really just an RGB hub with buttons. You can't actually use it as a remote unless you want to drill holes in your case to feed cables through. The lighting presets on the ""remote"" are very limited. For example, there's no way to set the LEDs to just one static color. To do that, you need to connect the remote to your PC via USB connection (for which there is apparently no included cable) and use Coolermaster's buggy, cumbersome software.<br /><br />In summation, despite achieving relatively good cooling performance, there's a lot of small details that I think Coolermaster neglected with this product. I somewhat regret purchasing this cooler, since there are other coolers out there with similar thermal performance and better aesthetics at the same price point. However, since it was such a pain to install and I really don't feel like opening my case again, I'm stuck with it for now.",neutral,negative

"I had a belkins wireless router from 10 years ago which still works fine, but I decided to purchase this one given the feature of parental control. It was very easy to setup. I thought the wireless signal should have been at least same as my old belkins, but in fact it was weaker than my old router. I set up the parental control via their app Tether, but this app didn’t function reliably. One of my computers failed to get back to internet even after I removed the parental control. I tried to login to tether to change it, but login kept failing after many tries. I had to call technical support whose response was very quick and very friendly, they instructed me to manipulate the app and at the end reset the router, but still did not work, finally they had to hang up which I would not blame. The support team r very good, but I think the problem was from the app and the router itself. I had to return it, I purchased it w high expectations but at the end, if I didn’t disconnect this router, couple of my computers would not get into internet.

Don't let this give you a bad impression - keeping these speakers a smidge to the left of flat, they sound great (as does U2).<br /><br />EDIT: I just want to clarify - these are good computer speakers.

"The CASIMY Universal Power Supply comes with 13 tips.

"If you're reading this review you've probably clicked on several different listings for this type of battery and read the small handful of reviews on each. I was in the same boat when I decided to pull the trigger on this particular listing. I'm not a technical person so I can't give you all the technical background on if this battery is performing to spec, but I can say that it is a VAST improvement over my previous factory battery that was dying within 10 minutes of being unplugged. This battery came with clear installation instructions as well as the tools needed for the job. I was able to watch some YouTube vids that made the process crystal clear. This battery did not have the issue with the connecting cord being too long like I read in reviews of other batteries. I followed the instructions to run the battery down and recharge a few times, but it took forever to run the battery down out of the box (playing Netflix with the brightness on 100 and power manager set to max performance) and since then I have had no issues at all with battery life. If you're looking for a battery replacement for your Dell XPS - this one is more than adequate and easy to install with the included tools.",positive,positive

"I have always liked Sony Products in the past but this unit's performance is under whelming. It should be great with all it's bells and whistles but I've had to return two of these units that had many problems. They had all problems listed in the many of one and two star reviews. Both units start and load fast when viewing the apps on the web however they would all start in SD resolution and take up to two minutes to go to HD resolution. They suffered from freezing up and sometimes required the power plug to be removed just to shut them off. fortunately I returned them both for full refund. I used very fast 115 mbps wired connection and my old Sony Blu-Ray was working perfectly when I exchanged them and now it continues to work perfectly since I put it back on my system.  To be honest I was astonished how bad both of them were.<br /><br />I think Sony's problem now is poor quality control. To be fair almost all of the different brands of Blu-Ray in the 2014-15 crop of players have up to 20% of poor reviews so what brand do you buy?  I am keeping my old Sony and I found another one like it.  They do everything I want them for but perhaps a little slower.<br /><br />They seemed to be a great bargain but the reality is they are cheaply made, and it is no bargain if they don't work.",negative,positive

"About 2 years ago, my family and I moved a lot further North than I had previously lived. I bought the older model, the HF3470, to help me wake up in the winter darkness. It was wonderful. Now, my 6 year old daughter has been having a very hard time waking up in the mornings for school (we have to get up at 6:15 to get them there in time, and starting in late September, it is still dark at that time). So I bought the new light alarm clock for myself and gave my old HF3470 to her.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of BOTH models. Right on the very first morning that I set the alarm clock in her room, she was up when the alarm went off. No complaints about how early it was, no dragging her out of bed, just an easily awoken child! We haven't even been late to school because I don't have to harass her for 30 minutes to get her going. It was like magic. She is using the light only (no sounds) with a loud clock radio across the room (so she cannot snooze the sound, even if she turns off the light!). It is easy enough to operate that my 6 year old can turn it on and off and use the light. (I did set the time and alarm for her, adjust the brightness, etc).<br /><br />I am also loving my new HF3520 model. It's true that the light at first is very red, then rather orange before it gets bright white. While this is not accurate to a true sunrise, I actually appreciate the color change because when I rouse before the alarm has gone off, but when the light has already begun lighting up, I can tell by the room's redness that it is not time to wake up all the way yet. I don't have to be facing the clock nor do I have to check the time. I like that!<br /><br />With both light-clocks, I have had them on my nightstand beside my bed, right at my eye/mattress level. My husband works swing shift so he often needs to sleep in, while I need to get up and get the kids ready for school and get myself off to work. I really appreciate that the alarms are unobtrusive enough to let him stay asleep, while still waking me up. The first morning I used the new clock, I had it set at brightness level 20 (max setting), and it DID wake him up (which is great to know for times we both WANT to get up at the same time). I set it to level 12 for the next morning, and it has been plenty bright for me and has not woken him since.<br /><br />After 2 years of listening to it, the birds tweeting on the old clock was starting to get on my nerves (but it was better than radio, the other option), but I haven't had the new clock long enough to say whether or not that will happen to me with the new sounds eventually. I was pleased, though, that the bird sounds on the new clock are different than the old clock, and I like the other sounds well enough too.<br /><br />The ONE problem I had with the HF3470 (the bigger, older model) is that the buttons are stiff and the device is light-weight, which means when you go to push the buttons along the front of the device, the whole alarm pushes back. So I end up pushing the device across the nightstand, but the buttons won't click. I had to use two hands: one to hold the device still and the other to push the buttons, until my husband brought me a rubber place mat and put it under my clock. Then it had enough grip to stay put while I was pushing the buttons. This is a minor complaint, though, considering how much I love that clock (and how well it has been working for my daughter!).<br /><br />The new clock does not have the issue with the buttons, which are more like a touch screen and nothing actually pushes inward at all. When I move my finger near the ""buttons"" on the front, little lights come on showing me where to press for each button (helpful for setting the alarm in the dark). When I withdraw my finger, the lights turn off. I had fun playing with that. It can sense me coming! I like the dimmable display and even though it cannot be turned all the way off, the lowest setting is plenty dim.<br /><br />In conclusion, I have 2 different models, and both are wonderful. I would buy either one again without hesitation. I prefer the large toggle switch on the older model for snoozing and setting the alarm because it's so easy to find, but either clock is great. If money is an issue, get the cheaper one and you still won't be disappointed. The upgraded light colors, buttons, style, and sounds of the newer model are great but might not be worth that much of a price difference for many.",positive,positive

"Not easy to apply, but that’s mostly my fault. I have trouble aligning the protector to the screen properly before the adhesive touches down, so I inevitably have to remove and reapply several times for a proper fit.<br /><br />I’ve had two of these now, and the first one had a few bubbles that I mostly managed to remove, as well as one or two pieces of dust caught despite my best efforts.

"UPDATE 02/16/19<br />So after a year and a half, the system works maybe 20% of the time. Most often I have to reset everything to get it to work and then only half the time it works, so I have to reset it again and wait. I'm not sure why that is because the transmitter is about 15ft from the receiver, but it's through 2 walls. I have the 164ft version so I figured it would work and it did initially, but soon after it would lose connection and wait to reconnect. I feel like I wasted a huge amount of money buying this and another receiver for my basement TV that is about 15ft directly under the transmitter. I had switched from the ActionTec because I couldn't find another receiver at the time and thought that upgrading to this system would be great, but it's nothing but a big hassle.

I purchased this adapter for an older computer I have.  It came with a CD to install the driver/software.  Unfortunately I couldn't get the computer to connect to my wireless network after it was installed..  So I ran a cable from the computer to  the router to have wifi access and updated the driver.  That's all it took!  I have a Netgear N router - but I think USB 1.0 ports on this computer (it's a 2.0 USB adapter).  Charter speed tests show 5.40 mbps down and 6.01 mbps up.  Since I have 60 mbps and get it on my other computers and ipad this is interesting to put it mildly!  But in spite of that it works...so if you have slow service to begin with or an old computer and you want a cheap adapter you may want to buy this..,positive,negative
"[[VIDEOID:57f5a33d751038721b9bd6ee6a77c9f1]] I wanted to like that product so much. The idea of having a larger mirror and a better view by putting the camera on my license was very appealing. the product look really good on the screen and was not disappointed when I opened the box.<br />But this product let me down ... hard! Mostly by shortcut in the hardware and also by a terrible software quality in the cam.<br /><br />Installation: Very straightforward. No problem there.<br /><br />Starting to use the product and I immediately seeing some heavy flickering of the screen. Turns out that when the lighting conditions are not ideal and are in between too dark or too much light, the dash cam does not seem to want to make a decision and seems to be flickering from one to the next. Horrible to use because it makes seeing what's coming behind very difficult.<br /><br />I also realized that if the cams keeps the same image on the screen for too long, you get a ghosting of the image for a few minutes creating bad artifacts on the screen. It could be the menu or it could be the view from the last parking position. This is very annoying as it is making assessing reading the situation more difficult. (see second clip in the video)<br /><br />The image quality on the screen is also low. The images have a tendencies to be too bright and with all the colors blown. This also increase the difficulty to read the screen. Looking at the recording everything happen to be fine there so I have to blame the quality of the display.<br /><br />I have also bought a high end Samsung SD Card for dash cam. When he card is getting full (128Gb did not last me more than a day and a half), the dash cam kept telling me that the card was slow, froze the screen and corrupted the file being recorded. See picture.<br /><br />Emergency detection: The sensor for saving the video in case of an emergency is way to sensitive even when I put it on low. So every pothole or 1/2"" (I didn't measure) drop of the road will generate an emergency within 3 days I have already taken 10Gb of my SD Card on non emergency emergency recording. Those 128Gb will not last long... See first clip in the video. That is a bridge junction junction and it triggered the emergency recording twice. Getting on the bridge and off the bridge.<br /><br />GPS accuracy: The GPS is not stable. Because the GPs is jumping all over the place, the dash cam translate that into movement. So the speed keep changing even when the car is not moving at all. See the third long and boring clip at the end of the video, the speed is recorded here where you can see that the car is clearly not moving.<br /><br />Speed accuracy: Well,  I had a 4 mph differences. I saw there was an option to correct it. I made the correction, now the car when seating still says that the speed is 4mph...<br /><br />Front camera: Very hard orient properly because it does not have enough travel to point down so I had to make the screen point up to get a chance to record what I wanted.<br /><br />Screen froze: While using the dash cam and switching views as I wanted to get back to the rear view, the screen completely stopped responding. I had to unplugged the device and wait for it stop and replugged it, effectively doing a reboot of the device.<br /><br />Conclusion: Weak screen, defective software that makes using the dash cam completely unpleasant. But the kicker and what justified the title is that the dash cam is a replacement for your existing mirror so when all those glitches are happening, you are left with no way to look behind. This could be very dangerous in some situation where the side mirrors are not covering what the indoor mirror is.<br />After 3 days of testing and about 25 miles put on it, I gave up. It's back in the box and returned to Amazon as defective.<br /><br />I'm going back Rexing. I got one a few years ago for another vehicle and it never let me down.",negative,negative

"While I really dislike retiring a perfectly good Acer R11, this Chromebook is pretty neat so far. My Acer R11's end of automatic updates led to this purchase instead of settling on Acer's next generation 11.6"" (which was a tough decision). This book is much heavier (aluminum body versus plastic, plus 13.5% tall screen). Keyboard is back lit, which I did not have before. It opens weirdly, when lifting the screen up, it pushes the keyboard upward in the back, so it does not sit flat anymore. Seems like that might be more stressful on the hinges. The USB-C power connector seems like it would wear out faster than the R11's power adapter mini-jack. This book is also a bit heavy when using as a tablet. It feels too heavy to use it in that manner, though I rarely used tablet mode before. As far as getting a Renewed Spin 713 at a much better price, everything was perfect except a small ding on the top beveled edge, noticeable at first, but I barely notice it now. My last Acer was Renewed also and as stated earlier, it clearly lasted 3 years and still had no problems except the expiration. This 713 model has support through June 2029. Either way, this AUE is going to create a lot of electronic waste in today's day and age when we should know better. A better system needs to be created so users can wear out their Chromebooks - a pay-for-more-support after the expiration option to reduce the waste.",positive,positive

"I was displeased to discover that voice-to-text is missing on this particular model (no microphone icon on the lower left of the keyboard).  If that had been made clear on the product comparison charts I wouldn't have bought it.  Only available on the HDX models I guess (my three-year old 7&#34; is an HDX).  And yet it has Alexa, so there's a voice engine in there somewhere.  I've already got an Echo, so I have no desire to use Alexa on the Fire, which involves finding the Fire, activating the screen, swiping the lockscreen, and pressing/holding the Home icon to engage Alexa.  I feel like this is a stripped-down model designed to get more people to use Alexa.<br /><br />Other annoyances I've found so far:<br /> - keyboard again: there are no long-press characters on the main keyboard (you can only access characters by switching to the underlying keyboard).<br /><br />- to open the lock screen you have to swipe up from the bottom - which of the four possibilities, has to be the most awkward one when holding the tablet.<br /><br />It was a good deal - probably too good to be true.

"A realistic review of these cheap headphones.<br /><br />OK, for the $10 they're a fair deal, but the hype here would make you think you're getting studio quality for $10 - no chance!<br /><br />Pros: the build quality is OK (nothing great, but a thick cable and decent housing), they're light and fairly comfortable, they reproduce sound.<br /><br />Cons: these are cheap drivers clearly tuned to bass, and at normal volumes they're tight, flat and muddy.  If you crank them, things are a bit more dynamic, but my days of blasting music directly into my ears in order to hear the details are long behind me. They might open up over time, but I doubt it, and not by enough.  I'm sure time spent with the EQ could help, but who wants to have to mess with the EQ every time you plug in phones?  I will say that I plugged these into a tablet that's always tinny sounding, and they sounded pretty good.<br /><br />So, want a cheap pair of headphones for people who don't know the difference (most people), or for playing bassy music at loud volumes, or because you need over-the-ear cans and only have $10?  Perfect!  Want something with good sound quality for listening to anything else than the beat at normal volume?  Keep looking.<br /><br />4 stars for a decent value, minus one for putting more into sales copy, packaging and branding than actual sound.",neutral,positive

"This has some stellar features and ease-of-use options that go above and beyond other gimbals.  The problem lies in the motors.  I tried this with a Canon 200D and a Sony A6400, both with kit lens and no external mic.  Both are well below the weight limit for this gimbal.  Both were too heavy for the motors.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The app - This app goes above and beyond what any other gimbal offers.  You can control EVERYTHING the gimbal can do.  Fast and responsive.  LOVE IT.<br />Features - There are many different software locks for the motors to keep your gimbal pointed at whatever you want or steady along the axis you want.  They work extremely well and movement was fluid....until it wasn't.  Has a nice Inception mode that works very well.  Selfie mode worked great.  Lots of things can be micro adjusted, too...Just so many great things going on with the software.<br />Build - lightweight and easy to handle.  Buttons were smooth and responded immediately.  Everything feels great in the hand, and the gimbal is light enough to carry comfortably for long shoots.  The tripod is wide and very stable, even under load and while moving the camera on the different axis.<br /><br />Con:<br />Motors - Too weak for my cameras.  At many angles there was juttering because the motors couldn't handle the weight.  Even sitting on a tripod and using tracking....sometimes the motors would give out and the camera would stall in place jerking around.  Not acceptable.  This does extremely well with a phone in a cage, though.<br /><br />So...Here's my final verdict:  I think this is an amazing gimbal overall...but not for an actual camera. If you've got a phone in one of those mountable cage rigs (a BeastGrip), this might be something to think about.  At the right weight, this could easily be used for some amazing shots.  The features are leaps and bounds over other gimbals...but the motors are just too weak for a DSLR.<br /><br />It's tough to give this a bad review because there was so much to like about this as a whole.  With an extremely light set up this would be the absolute perfect gimbal.  Honestly, if you've got a Beastgrip, you're obviously willing to spend money for phone videography....This will be the best gimbal for you.  It just didn't work for me....I sent mine back.",neutral,positive

"I hate to say it but my favorite part of this whole package was the included brained HDMI cable. Yes its built of sturdy metal, and yes the instructions are simple, but after getting my 32&#34; LCD on there, noticed that the brackets attached to the TV portion sort of protrude from the bottom and to me that's not very cosmetically appealing. All in all, I felt like being bulky was important in a TV wall bracket but this was a little too bulky in my opinion. Perhaps another design that shortened the brackets on the top and bottom would have addressed that well.",neutral,positive
"First kudos for including an 80 plus Power supply (flex ATX) in this case, it helps explain the overall cost and shame on the vendor for not specifically calling out this features (or even being able to answer my question on it prior to purchase).  I like this size/form factor for a basic (office) PC as its compact/small but not as tedious or difficult to build as a tiny  iTX based system case that often costs more money overall to build.  Also no shortage of ports on mATX as can sometimes happen with iTX.  Anyway the quality of this case is better than average I'd say, the steel feels solid enough and put together well.  It has one slim chassis fan at the front which seems OK but I find the slim fans tend to fail sooner, and if the case cooling was better design would not be needed at all.  The biggest problem with this case and why I will not order it again is the cooling.  It has a metal and plastic tray on top that is designed to hold a slim DVD drive or 2.5 or 3.5 inch disk.  Not only does the tray sit right on top of the CPU cooler greatly obstructing it from cooling your CPU, the tray is such that the font plastic bezel doesn't snap in at the top all the way if you remove it because you don't need these obsolete devices in your small PC (optical drive and external disk).  All you need is to use is an M.2 NVMe that is included in nearly every motherboard and throw out this tray but then you will need to glue the front bezel to secure it so the top doesn't flop out.  This was easily solved with a couple drop of glue in the upper right corner of the bezel to glue it to the metal chassis and on a plastic nub that pokes out under the optical drive and sets into a hole in the metal to line the bezel up correctly.  Once this is glued you can toss out the useless tray that hold obsolete accessories most don't care about to allow your CPU cooler to do its job.  This is probably sufficient for a 65W or less CPU.  The case really should have holes punched in the removable case cover to allow the CPU cooler to push air directly out of the case rather than relying on that slim case fan.  For this reason I will not purchase this case again but rather will seek an updated model with perforations in the case lid.",neutral,positive

"I now have four Dymo printers (this being the 4th). However, only one of the four was in use prior to this unit arriving. The others have had there own sets of issues. And sadly, this one (Dymo LabelWriter 550) is not a stranger to problems.<br /><br />I'll just list the issues here so not to carry on.<br /><br />(1) Installation is very clunky. I've tested this unit both with Win 10 Pro & Win 11 Pro. The printer was never detected despite following the documentation install order. MAKE SURE software is installed first before attaching the hardware (printer) to your PC. If possible, it may be a good idea to remove all instances of previous Dymo software (from older Dymo units) before installing. Then reboot your system. However, this is only if you're able to do so (as you might need to put the old unit back in place).<br /><br />(2) If you are planning on networking this unit, then make sure to buy the TURBO version. This unit (LW 550) is USB only. And shared networking through Windows, while doable, is also a clunky experience. In contrast, my older LW 330 was shared b/t 2 workstations that are used solely for label printing. And had no issues with Windows networking as well as printing from web based software (another challenge that the 550 failed).<br /><br />(3) You must use Dymo branded labels. There is an RFID chip on the label spool that is sensed by the printer. If you put in a 3rd part roll of labels they will not work. The cool thing is that if your unit is working correctly, then the label type AND amount of labels left on the roll is detected & display in Dymo Connect software. However, I would forgo this novelty for the ability to use 3rd party (cheaper) labels.<br /><br />(4) The printer never detected under Windows despite following the proper setup procedure. It wasn't until I manually added the printer (after the Dymo install was completed) that I was able to get the printer to go. This was done by going into Printers & Scanners, letting Windows attempt to find the printer, clicking on my printer is not listed, then performing a manual install by matching a USB port to the printer. So it appears that the driver & port are there, but the install never adds the printer to Printers & scanners. Again, very clunky.<br /><br />Overall, if I had to make a recommendation I would have to say stay away from this particular model. And just based on my history with other Dymo models, I may even lean in further & say if you need a label printer for your business (or any situation where your label printer must be up & running at all times), possibly stay away from Dymo all together. Perhaps for the home user who needs to print on occasion this unit may be acceptable. But for a professional setting, this is a no-go for me.",neutral,positive

Decided to test this screen protector out as I was sick of wearing my blue light filter sunglasses at work and at home. So far this does seem to help but I still have night shift mode enabled as I'm looking at a screen sometimes 16 hours a day.

"Bought this about a year ago and have been, for the most part, pretty happy with the unit. The complaints that people were having when I originally purchased have been largely mitigated over time.<br /><br />However.<br /><br />The design of the dock locking system is rather substandard in my opinion. The lock stopped functioning over time and it cannot be repaired without picking up a replacement dock. Not acceptable.<br /><br />This next complaint isn't really Samsung's fault, but it is a factor in whether or not I would purchase the unit. Windows 8.1 will, for the most part, not work on this unit. I have seen three units attempt to make the upgrade, only one actually completed the install, and it wasn't particularly stable. And worse yet, getting these three units back to Win8 was a nightmare.<br /><br />It's not a particularly powerful system. This isn't altogether surprising, but I wonder if using 32-bit windows coupled with only 2gb of memory might have hampered the performance of the system. The CPU could be at fault, I suppose. But in general, if there's ANY sort of multimedia work going on (playing h.264 videos local on the unit, for example) the system has trouble. It's pretty much only good for web browsing, and word processing.<br /><br />The good news? When the system performs as expected (docked as laptop, undocked as tablet), it's a wonderful system. The pen is a nice feature, especially as it is tucked into the unit. The screen is bright and colorful, and the touchscreen is perfectly accurate.<br /><br />But all of that can't really outweigh the drawbacks. I would not recommend this unit.",neutral,positive

"This is a good starter Notebook for those getting into the next generation computer game a little late. With a Vista compatible setup at a relatively low price, the computer sounds like a great deal, but you will be more disappointed in this computer than happy with it in a couple of months.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />Screen - Not too shabby. Most companies are releasing pretty good and pretty bright screens, so that's shouldn't be a big concern. I was afriad it would look washed out, but HP usually does a pretty good job on the screen.<br /><br />Multi-Drive - The DVD burner is a nice touch, but don't get too excited, keep reading.<br /><br />Good Ports - Including S-Video<br /><br />CONS: - almost everything<br /><br />Processor - Not a dual core. This is a huge disappointment, considering almost every competitor on the market has a dual core processor. It is a 64-bit processor (which is required for the Ultimate Vista), but low benchmarks makes the price not so suprising.<br /><br />RAM - 512MB, for a Vista laptop, you need a 1GB minimum, no questions. 2GB if you want a smooth run these days, but anything under 1GB is going to give you headaches.<br /><br />80GB HD - Vista-related programs are probably going to take a huge chunk out of that, DirectX 10 programs will be heavy, and with hard drives becoming cheaper by the months, you'd expect 120GB from a budget notebook.<br /><br />nVidia 6150GT - Normally this is a good thing, but it's a battery killer. THE BATTERY IN THIS LAPTOP IS AROUND 110 MINUTES... THAT'S TERRIBLE!!!!!! A 6150 is nothing to brag about anyways, it's not much better than a Integrated Media Accelerator... and it is still using up your RAM. Imaging how slow your computer is going to run on a Vista computer with 384MB of function RAM. This is a huge letdown. You can't even enjoy games on this laptop, let alone actually taking advantage of the DirectX 10 games coming out later this year.<br /><br />WHERE'S THE LIGHTSCRIBE I WAS PROMISED? - I don't know if it was just an Amazon.com mistake for a few of the shipments, or if it's for all of them, but I'm not the only one that was gipped on the LightScribe. All the other formats read and burned alright, but the LightScribe didn't do so hot.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: This laptop does nothing right. HP went in the wrong direction with this laptop and gave a false hope laptop for the people that just want to have Vista, but don't meet the specs for one. Not only will this computer not run Vista well, it won't even run Windows XP that well, and that's the biggest shame.",negative,positive

"This is NOT a 120Hz screen, and it’s certainly not a very good screen either. While brightness is good overall, it’s very much in the “cold” end of the spectrum, with no “pop” in the color gamut, as you’d expect from the description. No amount of tuning(short of paying to have it done) makes much difference, it’s just “flat”. In fact, the panel shows as manufactured in 2014 (Chui Mei/Innova). The MSI model number shows up as GP73 8RF, which, according to MSI’s website is for release in LA only, and not a US model at all. I don’t know what kind of crap MSI is trying to pull, but Amazon needs to straighten this out. VERY disappointed.",negative,negative

"My HP computer stopped working unexpectedly. I attempted to file a claim with Asurion. Their initial response: ""It looks like this issue is still covered by the original manufacturer's warranty. Please contact Hewlett Packard at...:. I knew my original manufacturer's warranty had to be expired. I did check with HP. The warranty had expired 14 months earlier. So I went back to Asurion and chatted with their online rep. It took about 45 minutes, but the result so far is that I will be emailed a shipping label. I will need to take my computer to a UPS facility and they will ship it to a repair facility free of charge, fix the computer, and return it to me in 10 days time. I will update this review at the end of the process. ***UPDATE*** So I was not sent just a shipping label. I was sent a large shipping box with styrofoam inserts suitable for protecting my computer. Included was the prepaid shipping label and instructions on how to prepare my computer for the shipping and the repair process. This is what is important to know: if you are not already backing up your files, it is vital that you do so. I don't know the full extent of what I have lost. I lost a child and have lost videos and photos that can't be replaced. I lost my digital tax records, which would have been an issue except I always print a hard copy. What I didn't lose, accidentally, were all the files I had moved from my previous computer to the one sent for repair, because moving the files went through my cloud storage, which I was using a bit randomly. Asurion warns that your computer may be reset, and I suspect this is done 100% of the time, as soon as they receive it and are able to do it. My computer was sent for repair because I couldn't turn it on, so I had no way to back my files at the last minute. Please learn from my mistake. The computer was also reset to the original factory specifications. I had paid extra for an upgrade: 2.9GHz Upto 3.8GHz. This is presumably lost as well. So just know that this will probably be part of your experience. But--except for the initial purchase of this coverage and the trip to the UPS shipping center, it cost nothing out of pocket.",neutral,positive

"I am a big fan of the Synology product and really like their product line up. However, I was bitterly disappointed when tech support informed me that you CANNOT run the Plex Media Server on this device. His reason: it does not have the resources to run such an intensive application. I have to call complete BS on that. You can copy up to 1 gigabit of data to/from this device in realtime. The throughput is excellent. Yet, it can't stream a 10 mbit video stream? That is ludicrous. If he had said I needed to upgrade the RAM in the device, fine. No problem. Keep in mind, I don't want to do any transcoding, or video conversion. It merely has to stream .mp4 files I compressed using handbrake over to my Roku, PC, or PS4. If can't serve that purpose then it has to go back.<br /><br />So while this is a quality piece of hardware, with a great management interface, I give it 1 star for being completely inadequate to do the 1 thing many consumers would want to buy this device for: serve movies to all our devices using the Plex Media Server. Super lame.",negative,positive

"Can't tell any difference in the reception, but like the idea of reducing my SAR exposure.  Overall, this product is fantastic.  I would prefer two changes.  One, it should be a Smart Cover.  How hard would it have been to put a magnet in the cover?  I didn't realize and if you aren't careful you will drain your batter pretty quickly.  Two, the lid should come all the way to the edge the way the Smart Cover does to make it easier to flip open.  The Smart Cover issue may make me return an othewise fantastic product.<br /><br />****update 1/18/13****<br /><br />I returned this case.  I saw no discernable change to the wifi distance/speed, etc.  It certainly made no difference to the LTE speeds when on LTE.  But two things were the final factors in returning this case.<br /><br />1.  The leather like interior of the screen cover constantly left a haze of leather like dust on my screen.  I didn't like opening my case to a dirty looking film on my screen.  The protector is supposed to help stop that, not cause it.<br /><br />2. The lack of a smart cover.  This case really should have had a smart cover built in for the money.  Apparently there are two companies with the same patent on the folding screen cover, Pong and Ozaki and that folding design is WELL WORTH IT.  The Ozaki cases don't do anything about reception/SARs but they do have the folding screen cover that I have come to love and they cost significantly less and have smart cover functionality.<br /><br />The one awesome thing about this case is its folding cover.  I am happy that I will not lose that with the Ozaki.  Once you have experienced the angles, stability, etc. you won't look at any other screen cover the same.<br /><br />Lots of promise and with some minor tweaks, this will be a fantastic case in the future.  I'll check back in a rev or two.",neutral,positive

The first thing I noticed when I opened the box is that the right-click button is on the side. Not convenient for a left handed person to use at all. I’ve tried to change the button settings but I haven’t found where you can do that. It’s plug and go. It does work well for either Mac or PC but just not for left-handers.,negative,positive

You will not get any help if it dies. Caveat emptor. I won’t buy refurbished again.",negative,positive
"I ordered this Eeyrnduy 2 Pack Rechargeable Lithium Battery pack to provide replacements for my aging Sony NP-BX1 batteries.  These new batteries are rated at 3.6V, 5.76Ah and 1600mAh of energy.

"Long story .....<br /><br />I have brighthouse internet and wasn't home when the installation person came. He claimed that this modem wouldn't work and thus used their own modem. I then connected this modem and called brighthouse to change the MAC address on their systems. After changing, the technician was able to restart the modem etc remotely. However, later when I tried using the internet, it would not work. Read a few forums and learnt that there was an issue with the bootfile and brighthouse technicians (at a higher level, not the junior level) need to update from their offices. Again called them and specifically asked for this.

Logitech's hardware setup interface is attractive enough, but I didn't find it particularly user-friendly or adequately interactive.  Once I had the remote set up, I realized that one has to start from ALL COMPONENTS OFF (including the cable box) to move through the various commands to get to the activity intended ...and, as I said, even that won't take you all the way through without grabbing the old remote.

"Surprisingly effective.<br /><br />This little 32 LED unit will mount to almost and smartphone or tablet and can work with many cameras as well. It has two form-fitting mounts for iPhones, one of which works on my Samsung  Galaxy S5. There is also a small shoe mount which can be used on any cold or hot shoe and, again mostly for smartphones and tablets, a dummy phone plug that fits into the phone's audio out socket.<br /><br />My unit took more than 6 hours for the initial charge and I am still trying to run it down. so far i've racked up three hours of use. I suspect charging will be a bit faster in the future. A remaining battery indicator would be nice.<br /><br />The unit throws out a considerable amount of light and people will not appreciate having to look directly at it. The Galaxy S5 has a single LED that can be used during video shots. It is reasonably bright. This unit casts, by my approximation, about three times more light.<br /><br />There's no case provided. There is an depress on/off switch in the back. Construction quality is nothing to rave about, but seems sturdy enough.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good unit at a very attractive price. If you do any shooting in dim environments, you want one. Maybe even two or three if you have an assistant or brackets to hold them<br /><br />Jerry",positive,positive

I love this Tablift. I was looking for something that would make it comfortable to read in bed. I can completely lay dow and then set up the Tablift and easily read until I’m ready to go to sleep. I’ve caught myself waking up to find that I’d fallen asleep before putting my tablet aside. During the day I used to get cramps in my left hand from holding my tablet while reading. With the Tablift I can set up my tablet in such a way that I don’t have to hold it to read.<br /><br />At first I thought I was going to have to remove my tablet from the case in order to use it. However I’ve found that I can put the iPad in the desired position and let the back half of the cover fit into the next slot enough that it will fold up to touch the top of the iPad. In that position I can securely lock the iPad into place. I’m actually going to order a second Tablift so that I don’t have to carry it upstairs and downstairs.<br /><br />If I had one suggestion I would ask that the slots be made a bit wider to accept both the iPad and it’s case. Perhaps if it then becomes too wide for just the iPad without the case they could provide a filler piece that could be placed in same slot as the iPad.,positive,positive

"This power bank is super helpful for the outdoors. I have a pretty buggy backyard and no outdoor outlet. Instead of getting one installed for hundreds of dollars, I got this power bank and it works so well. Now I have my bug zapper and even some USB-powered string lights for times that I'm entertaining or just having dinner outside. The battery lasts very long and I was extremely surprised about how fast it recharges. I have a portable power bank with a fraction of the amount of power storage that takes more than twice as long to charge. I was able to fully charge this in about 5 hours with the included USB C charger that even works to charge my phone at faster speeds. It is a little heavier than I expected but still very portable and not an issue. Also, there's a fan inside of it to prevent it from overheating in the hot summer weather which I'm sure helps the battery life and extends the life of the product itself. I can;t wait until I go on a road trip or camping to use this I'm sure it will be a game changer!",positive,positive
I bought the 3ft and the 6ft of the RiteAV RCA Stereo Audio Cables. Both have the same issues. When I have my laptop connected to the stereo the sound will cut out intermittently or just the sound on the left or right speaker will cut out. Same issues if my Zune is connected to the stereo using these cables. I have the television connected to the same stereo using regular RCA cables I purchased separately and the sound never cuts out so it's not a stereo issue. Can't be a laptop or Zune issue either as they work fine connected to other speakers.<br /><br />So basically buy these cheap cables at your own risk.,negative,negative

I had a feeling these weren't going to be any good because my impression of Beats  products is negative but I wanted something designed for activity that I could use while working outside. These need to be in the case to create a bluetooth connection.  The case has rounded sides to it and the button you need to hold down for 5 seconds to connect is out near the edge.  Additionally the curved additions to the body of the ear buds are right over the button.  The buds don't connect via Bluetooth reliably so you end up pushing the the button while the case is rocking around with the buds in your way the whole time...total cluster.  I returned these because eventually they wouldn't connect at all and replaced them with a pare of Bose buds that connect the second you take them out if the case and put them in your ears.

"This router replaced my old trusty WRT54G, which was performing adequately, but just didn't have the speed or range.  The E2000, now superceded by newer models has performed well over the past 18 months.  I read many review, including those that trashed this model.

I had no setup problems, and the range is an improvement on the predecessor unit.  I live in a modestly sized circa 1920's house with thick plaster lath walls.  The router is on the second floor and I get good coverage on the first floor.

"This is a deal-breaker for me--I can't open the lid all the way, and on the desk stand I have, this means video call framing is off (see photo 1 of gold Macbook Air M1), and I can't see the screen when I sit with the laptop in my, well, lap.  My old Macbook Pro 2017 case (see space gray in case photo), which is evidently still sold here on Amazon by RUBAN, actually stops short of the back edge, so that the lid can open fully.  I do see that my old Pro is scratched on that back corner and the top case has cracked, but if the laptop can't function properly it's kind of moot. I guess I can't really send this one back since it's part of the set, but I may look for another one that doesn't interfere with the lid opening.<br /><br />I do like the soft carrying case, although if I use all 4 corner pockets, the thicker Macbook Air rear doesn't align with the fuzzy padded edge bumper that goes along the zipper, so I guess I'll only use the 2 front corner pockets, or not put it all the way in the rear ones (see photo).  The screen protector is not really what I bought the set for, although I did take it out of the bag and notice it has a couple of warped spots so it seems like it would be hard to get to lay flat wtihout bubbles, and the keyboard cover is merely serviceable.  I think I prefer the silicone types that I've used on my kids' Macbooks because they mold to the keyboard better, but even though this one seems to slip off more (and I don't want to ruin the keys with the included adhesive), it is thinner and, like my previous one, seems to intrude less on typing.",neutral,positive

"I bought this to enable an older laptop to use the 5 GHz band on a dual band n-router. I should have read the product specs more carefully. This adapter only works in the 2.4 GHz band, which means it is not truly 802.11n compliant. The limitation makes it essentially a G-band adapter. Most ISPs provide 20-50 Mbs Internet connections. If you are hoping to increase web surfing speeds over 802.11g (54 Mbs), gains are likely to be imperceptible.<br /><br />Pros:  1) Impressive range for a device of its size. 2) Truly small adapter, you hardly know it's there.<br /><br />Cons:  1) It is not truly an N-adapter, no 5 Ghz functionality, which was a deal breaker for me.  2)  Its speed was limited to 65 mbs per second, only a slight jump from 54 Mbs/sec 802.11g.  3) It has a flashing blue light when operating which they neglected to mention.  (Not terrible, but deserves mentioning.)<br /><br />It has a maximum speed of 150 Mbs/second which can only be achieved using wide channels (40 Mhz), which you must enable in hardware setup. In the crowded 2.4 GHz band where many devices operate, using wide channels could interfere with other 802.11a/b/g/n devices.  Some routers lock out 40 Mhz channels in 2.4 Ghz, and most ""fallback"" to 20 Mhz width when interference is likely.  This is called ""coexistence"" mode and is part of the 802.11n spec.  You may not be able to achieve more than 65 Mbs per second depending your router and traffic in your area even with wide channels selected (which is not recommended at 2.4GHz or in high traffic areas).<br /><br />I returned the Edimax.  The single band limitation made it essentially a G-band device (not operating in the much faster 5 GHz range).  It failed to meet my needs, but it may work for others looking for a very small 2.4 GHz adapter with good range, if speed isn't the primary concern.",neutral,negative

"I can't recommend this. After a weekend of heavy use it's just no good on two fronts. First the battery, which was fully charged and after 1 minute of use showed as a low battery - as I was filming a wedding!!! luckily it lasted for 7 minutes but the scare was enough to freak out.

"My rig: a Panasonic 50&#34; flatscreen TV, Comcast Xfinity hi-def cable box, Panasonic Blu-ray player, a Denon standard DVD player, Roku Streaming Stick.<br /><br />I tried two different ones of this Sabrent switch, and neither of them worked.  The Roku would not work when plugged into the Sabrent.  And, I could not get the Denon standard DVD player to be recognized by the system if I had it plugged into the Sabrent with the Blu-ray player plugged in also.<br /><br />With each unit, the Xfinity cable box acted very weird after I had it plugged into the Sabrent for a few days, and finally the cable box would not even work.  I spent two days on the phone with Xfinity techs and we finally determined that I would have to have the cable box replaced, which I did.<br /><br />Now, running WITHOUT the Sabrent, everything, including the new cable box and the Roku works just fine, as do both the DVD players.

Both are fake RGB devices whose settings cannot really be changed (other than to turn on or off). Keyboard is full-time rainbow backlit, no other options. The case this pc comes in is functional but has one extreme flaw: The front panel LED light that reminds us what brand the case is, CAN NEVER BE TURNED OFF. It's extremely bright and pulses full-time. I had to put black gaffer tape over the case in order to be able to sleep while I left it on to upload files.<br /><br />So, if you're going to buy this, set aside another $70-$120 for a decent keyboard and mouse, plus a roll of gaffer tape.",neutral,negative

And it's satin-smooth, so it never sticks to my fingers as I type. And at least as important for me, it's translucent, so I can still type in the dark.<br /><br />If you take the cover off, you have to realign it with the keyboard precisely to prevent any air pockets between it and the keys, but the fit is so well engineered that this isn't a problem. Just match to two keys and let fall. Oh, this cover sticks to the keyboard even at a near vertical angle.",positive,positive

"Got these after buying a similar pair for my husband.  He loves his, but I was underwhelmed.  I compared sound quality and his were slightly better.

But I struggled to find anything that offered a smaller fit, so I went with these.<br /><br />Pros however were easy bluetooth pairing and function, battery life seems solid so for the cost these are a good value.

"Battery grip for a Nikon D3000 arrived well ahead of schedule.<br /><br />On opening, noted that it says on the box it comes with a AA cell holder, but it does not. (Also says in the text it comes with a 6 cell AA holder)  The grip will only hold 1 or 2 EN-EL9a batteries.  No possible way to use AA cells with the grip that was sent.  Not really too worried about falling back to AA cells though.<br /><br />Now, I ordered a NEEWER unit, however cannot find NEEWER anywhere on the unit or the box.  Box says it is made BY MEIKE, a multi-power battery pack.<br /><br />If the two EL9a's burn out, always have a spare pair in the case or pocket anyway.<br /><br />The picture on Amazon shows batteries going in from the left side, however the batteries go in from the rear of the grip instead.<br /><br />That being said, fits the camera well, feels good in the hand and does not require any fitting to make work.<br /><br />The IR emitter did not work at first, but after pressing the button several times it did begin working and set the camera off fine in vertical position.<br /><br />Mostly just black plastic, but the grip piece under the lens itself seems wrapped in a rubberized covering that looks and feels good.<br /><br />While not super heavy duty, it does appear decently made and adds to the look and feel of the D3000.<br /><br />Overall pleased with the purchase so far.<br /><br />Would recommend it as a battery grip for a D3000, and would purchase again, for the money, it is a great accessory effectively doubling shooting time.",positive,positive

"Great laptop so far. The track pad is probably the best feature of the laptop. If you like the Macbook you will love this track pad. The keyboard is nice, very good for typing but a few things are laid out weird so it takes some getting used to. The things I really hate about this laptop, and when I say hate I mean hate. The first is the fact that I cannot take out the battery. I like to use my laptops battery out and just supplied from the wall. Unfortunately with this laptop I have to have the battery in at all times. That puts an unnecessary strain on the batteries overall life. Another thing I hate is the forced Mcafee protector when you first get the computer. The first thing to be deleted was that horrible program. Other than that this is a great laptop for the price. The charger is very nice, no more brick in between your cables, Asus has instead opted for the Apple style where all the brick is on the plug. You know the longer I type the more I begin to notice that this laptop has gone down the path of Apple. Man that is a scary thought. Well I hope this review has been helpful. For now I totally recommend this laptop. But just know that if you want to upgrade the ram or anything else it will be a huge pain.<br />Update: Man, I really wanted to like this laptop and I still do but it has failed me. Update on RAM, it apparently is soldered in, or at least from what I can tell. My WiFi chip started to fail and was causing my computer to crash constantly. Originally I thought this was just a problem with the Windows 10 Anniversary addition, but I watched the patterns and noticed an anomaly. My computer was already having trouble with the WiFi adapter not responding (I just figured it was a strange driver issue) but then I noticed something strange. I could use my laptop for as long as I wanted as long as I did not use the internet. Once I used the internet it may have worked for a while, but would always eventually crash my computer. I could boot in SafeMode though with Networking and had no problems there which was strange. I'm still not fully sure why it would work in SafeMode, maybe it didn't ask the chip for as much, I know Bluetooth was disabled in that mode. But I have fixed all that now. Thankfully I had an old laptop with a dead CPU so I stole its adapter. Unfortunately this was an older slower chip without Bluetooth, but it works. Now for the process of changing the chip, that was annoying. I do not own any equipment for taking apart devices so  I used a sharp knife to initially pry up art of the shell, and then I used a butter knife to do the rest of the popping of the tabs. I unscrewed the bottom screws in the beginning as a just in case if they would have affected the process. Once all tabs were undone I thankfully was able to use the detachable head of a screwdriver, with electrical tape rapped around it for grip to unscrew the screw on the adapter. I did this because I did not want to have to deal with detaching the ribbon cables. But with all said in done everything is working great now. I really hate the road laptops are heading down these days. Older laptops used to have doors to change out things like ram, hard drives, and even these wireless adapters. I love ASUS but I have to lower my rating. It seems that for there cheaper products they do not care enough to use quality parts.",negative,negative

"In order for you to receive a TV signal that can be used by your antenna, you have to basically 'see' where the signal is coming from. What this means is, if there are large buildings, trees, hills/mountains or any other large structures or elements of nature between your antenna and the signal, your antenna WILL NOT receive the signal. That's just a basic law of physics. An antenna that WILL pick up the signal if it's blocked will have to be a roof (or mounted on a high structure) mounted regular antenna such as the ones made by RCA or Winegard. These are not expensive but they do have to be mounted as high above the ground as possible. Once these are mounted higher than most of the trees and structures that block the signal they can finally pick up some of the signal and provide a picture for your TV. If you add a booster to the antenna it will enhance the signal and your TV picture will be much clearer and more stable and you may even receive a few more channels. The Mohu Leaf may work if you live within a few miles of where the signal is coming from and there's nothing blocking a clear view between the signal and the antenna. If not, this antenna simply will not work.",negative,negative

"UPDATE 4/14/21: I'm giving up on this watch. It's always something. The sleep mode is mostly  better now but won't register some nights. Now the weather fails to sync so I have ghost clouds instead of weather forecasts  for the week. When I try to sync it manually it just cycles and cycles for several minutes and still no weather. I've updated location to allow the watch full access and still nothing.<br />DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS WATCH. IT HAS MULTIPLE ISSUES DEPENDING ON THE LAST UPDATE. Now the battery has gone from 14 days to 3 1/2 days after one year.<br /><br />PREVIOUS UPDATE:  After switching to an iPhone this works better even though a previous update killed it on my Android phone. The Thing that irks me now after another update is that the sleep app is way off. Lately I am told I've been awake for 3-5 hours a night which earns me a  30 to 50 rating. Never got better than a 80 rating so far. They did include the REM sleep to the graph which is nice. Since they changed the app name to Zepp it hasn't really been the same. The few other things I use it for, steps and watch faces and time of day and compass work okay. Battery life is the best feature.<br /><br />The price has gone down $40 from when I bought it; maybe because of the Zepp app you have to use on your mobile phone. It's not the best.<br /><br />I bought this watch to use in counting laps while swimming, but the Covid has put the stops on that this year. It was the only watch in this price range--since reduced-- that offered a swim mode although it is GPS distance (miles) rather than laps counted.<br /><br />The battery lasts 10-14 days. My wife's Fitbit Versa 2 needs charging every couple of days. I don't leave the face always on. If you leave it always on, you'll probably have to charge it in 3 days.  In the econ mode you have to tilt it to your face or click on the stem to make the face visible. A good trade off for not having to charge your watch all the time.<br /><br />My main gripe about this watch is that when someone sends me a text message, it repeats 3-4 times on my watch. This seems to be a problem with several of the Amazfit watches according to some of the forums I have visited to remedy the situation without success. It's annoying and difficult to see texts from others in the long line of repeat sms messages. UPDATE: Buying an iPhone to pair with this watch seems to have solved this problem for me.<br /><br />I tried the music mode and it works if you already have music playing on your phone. It will display the song playing, the Album or CD Title, volume control, pause and play, next and previous song controls. However if you are on economy mode, the music face disappears and you have to search for the music control again.<br /><br />I used the Find Phone and Found it easily, but your phone must have power obviously. It will ring or force volume higher if playing music, lol. UPDATE: This find phone function no longer works. Beware updates. It's like Microsoft. Everytime they update to make it better it causes glitches.<br /><br />If they could fix the multiple repeat sms messages and tweak the sleep mode with more info this would be a pretty good watch. Right now its only good. Would I buy it again? Maybe, if the swim mode is good. I'll have to wait to find out.",neutral,positive

The idea is great but the unit kept saying it was unplugged when I had it plugged in. It would work for awhile if I wiggled the unit just a little bit.

"I'm a bit of an electronics junkie and managing all of my cords has gotten a bit overwhelming.  This helps me to have a single unit where everything can be plugged in and is not such an eye sore as the power strips I was using.  However, one of the main reasons I purchased this particular model over similar offerings was that it offered a 6.5 foot cord.  For some, the fact that the cord is stored inside the base may be great.  But, for me, this posed an issue.  It's difficult to pull the cord out of the base.  Additionally, the unit needs to be allowed to spin in order to retrieve or retract the cord.  This means that you must determine the link that you need before you plug anything into it and,, if you decide to change the length, you need to unplug everything.  Additionally, all of the USB plus are in one location.  This leaves a bit to be desired for ease of access.  All-in-all, a nice unit but some design corrections would warrant an even higher rating.",neutral,positive

"Update July 7, 2021: Got the replacement today and tried it. Thankfully both side works. But it sounds HORRIBLE! Can't believe they took a perfectly engineered product and messed it up so bad! Not worth sending this back.<br /><br />Update July 3, 2021: Tried it for the first time at the gym and the right bud won't work at all! What a disappointment! The control that's attached to the right bud works so I know it's not the whole right side that's bad. And I got a second pair because the first one that I got a year or so ago is still working and sounds so good! Maybe they are mass producing these too much and forgetting to check for quality. I have asked for a replacement, let see if the new one is any better. REALLY disappointed!<br /><br />Update June 2021: Gave it a 5, now 4. Got a second pair because the first one is awesome! Not sure why but they changed the angle slightly of the wire where it attaches to the buds and it's making it not fit too snugly inside my ear anymore. Why change a perfect thing? The sound is still awesome! I want to keep the second pair because I am taking a trip overseas and don't want to without one if the first one breaks or gets ""lost"".<br /><br />2020<br />Really perfect for sleeping in! I use the smaller of the tops and it rests very nicely just inside of the my ear canals. The sound isn't bad at all. I listened to a lot of soundscapes and brain-training stuff while I sleep so these are perfect. I am really impressed by these.The wires are pretty thin. I hope I don't damage them too soon. The price is very economical so I am not too worried about getting replacements. The right bud do sound a little different from the left, doesn't seem to have the same sound dynamic as the left one. The left one has more bass. But I am not going to complain too much about it since I am not planning to listen to any symphonies or grunge using these.",negative,positive

"***UPDATE*** (with a second unit, the replacement)<br />I really gave this Chromebook a chance only because it is really beautiful. And NO, it is not worth it. It crashes at least once every 2 days. Sometimes the flickering issues can be solved just by closing and opening the laptop, but sometimes it takes more than 5 minutes to work again. The mouse pad and the space key never worked the way they were supposed to, and writing on this chromebook (which was the whole purpose of buying it) was just a pain. I finally returned the item and wanted to try a third product for the last time. It had so many good reviews, that I thought that maybe was just bad luck. But then the seller decided that my only option was a refund, and refused my replacement order. Then Acer (the seller here) tried to charge me $59.00 for a Restocking Fee. Thankfully, the Amazon Customer representatives assisted me, and I got my full refund.<br />If you read carefully the reviews, even the ones with more than 3 stars complain about the same issues, mentioning the fact that they just got used to a chromebook that randomly shuts down or freezes. This is not a quality chromebook. Save your money and your time.<br /><br />------Original review:<br />I have mixed thoughts about this Chromebook. I had the ASUS Chromebook C201PA-DS02 for a little bit more than a year and I loved it until it started to give in. The system was amazing and it gave me exactly what I needed to keep writing my dissertation everywhere I went. However, the shiny plastic seemed flimsy since day one, and it always had a cheap made look. But how could I complain when I could have more than 20 tabs on 3 different windows open with all my dissertation sources and documents, while still being able to stream a movie on Netflix without an issue?! My great relationship with that ASUS made me leaning toward a second Chromebook.<br /><br />After extensive research, I found the aluminum making of this model so attractive, enough for me to ignore the complaints regarding the functionality. The first model I received started to shut down randomly every 1-2 hours the very first day. Then it was more like every 30-40 minutes. If I dared to open more than 8 windows it slowed down so much that it was becoming quite complicated to navigate through pages, or to keep on writing on Google Docs. I ordered a replacement. Then... I had the same issue: this model also shuts down randomly every 1-3 hours (just as I write this review it happened for the third time today). Sometimes I just have to close it and open it again, but when I have to log in and open my documents and pages all over again, I find hard to keep loving the prettiness of this Chromebook. Because indeed it is very pretty, it is the best looking Chromebook on the market... but I think I will have to say good bye to it.<br />Furthermore, even though this model does not collapse when I open more than 15 tabs, the keyboard is not as responsive as the first model I received (the space key especially doesn't seem to work as it should). The mouse pad is also not as responsive as the one on the first model. It is a shame, I had high expectations on this Chromebook due to the reviews and the fine making of this aluminium model... but even my now crappy ASUS works better than this brand new Chromebook.",negative,positive

It does work well and is very smooth, but if you are looking for an ergonomic product to help with carpal tunnel, check out the Smartfish Technologies K2418B ErgoMotion Keyboard instead.

"I can't even put into words how much I love this tablet.  I have an iPad and also had an Asus tablet that was a huge piece of junk.  When I got my Lenovo (who I named Lenny) I was skeptical because of all of the issues I had with my Asus, but this tablet is the best on the market in my opinion.  The sound is Dolby Digital and the graphics are better than some tv's I have in my house.  I love the stand that is attached but the best part is the battery life.  I can go a full week without charging the tablet even when watching movies.  If you use the tablet for general use it will give you about 20 hours of battery life.  My ipad now sits in a drawer and I sent my Asus back to Amazon.  It as a headphone jack on the right side and you can buy an attachment keyboard that slides into that spot so you can use as a laptop.",positive,positive

It took a while to dawn on me, but they were sharing 100mbps over old cables.

"Seems to work decently, but is not capable of maintaining 1 Amp output while keeping voltage within USB specs. Loading it up with a one amp load resulted in the voltage dropping to 4.4 volts, which is out of alignment with USB specifications.

If you keep your load at this level, it will stay within an acceptable voltage range. Otherwise, find a more powerful unit. This one is good only for low-load USB devices. Charging also takes forever.<br /><br />As long as you know of these limitations, then this device might work okay for you.",positive,positive

I'm not sure it's that easy to change remotes for this television, because I couldn't get other device remotes working with this. They easily hook up with Bravia. The support site has all the codes you should need, but even after a call to support (really nice, helpful support), I couldn't get other remotes to work with this television. They are selling a Vizio Universal Remote that is just as bad looking a this one.

Not sure how LG apps are, but Bravia's are definitely better than this.<br /><br />If you're not buying this television for the apps, buy their lower model without the apps, and the picture and sound will most probably be quite acceptable as well.

"Unfortunately, all the features that are supposed to make this device stand-out, fall on their face.  The HDMI port is a joke.  I plugged this into two different model HDTVs (both 720p/1080i max resolution).  When you power it on (which takes about 30-45 seconds to initialize) the display color isn't correct.  In fact it's missing two of the color channels - RED and GREEN.<br /><br />I had to actually plug the included (non-standard) component adapter into the TV, turn the drive on (without HDMI plugged in), get into the menu, switch the drive's display settings to 720p. Then while leaving it on, plug in the HDMI cable and switch the input on the TV for it to display all the colors.  If you turned the drive off - or it froze and you had to reset it, you had to complete all those steps from the beginning.<br /><br />Also, the device tends to freeze - A LOT.  I had to reboot it by holding the power switch in the back so many times I lost count (it was over 10 times in one sitting).  If you do actually get it to play back an AVI DivX movie, don't hold your breath.  It completely froze 5 times with 5 different movies, all of which play fine on my Xbox360, Xbox (softmodded), and computer.  This device, though potentially the most useful device for storing and playing back a large library of ripped DVDs, doesn't even work like its manual and ads say it should.  On top of that Iomega decided to format the drive NTFS - which means you have to reformat it if you want to plug the USB into a Mac or Linux computer to start copying your library to it.<br /><br />Avoid this thing like the plague.

"I guess I am less enthused about this bag than others. I received it yesterday and upon initial inspection I thought it would do the job, but it's design is far below what I was expecting. Here's what struck me as odd.<br /><br />1. The depth of the internal compartments (and the whole bag) could have been about two inches more shallow. At least for my equipment. Even with standing my lenses vertically, there was about two-and-a-half inches of room for them. The only lens I have that was too tall to stand vertically was my 300mm. Since the 300 is too tall it will take up the bulk of the space in the center.<br /><br />2. The tripod lashings on the right side work much better than I suspected they would. The problem here is that with my tripod strapped on the bag, the whole thing becomes lop-sided making me have to cinch up the right shoulder strap to try and equal it out. This compensation of the straps actually puts more strain on my right shoulder. A mono-pod would be a much better companion for this bag, but a mono-pod can only take you so far.<br /><br />3. The shoulder straps are really uncomfortable. They seems to know this was a flawed design of the bag by the softer foam placed where the straps meet the collar bone. Also, why CaseLogic didn't include a chest strap (to connect the two shoulder straps across the chest) I don't know. The should straps ride to the outside of the shoulders causing a lot of fatigue. A chest strap to bring everything back to the center is really needed on this bag.<br /><br />4. The whole bag rides very high on your back. I suppose this is a good thing, and I'm not sure if it is the shoulder straps or the foam on the back, but it feels really awkward and unnatural.<br /><br />Some of the things I like are the camera sling. That is a really nice feature, although I don't really know that it's really for all camera bodies. I have a Nikon D5100 and I had to do some adjusting to make sure the body would fit in the bag so I could close the top easily.<br /><br />My opinion is that the real selling point of this bag is the waterproof bottom, but that isn't enough for me to want to keep it. I've had some decent luck in the past with LowPro so I'll likely give them another try with a bigger bag.",neutral,positive
"I wanted to have uniform sound volume as I move around from room to room.  Having four speakers turned out to be the solution. From other reviews I knew that battery life would be limited, so I am reserving battery use until I need to take them into an area without an electrical outlet.  Set-up was simple, just take them out of the box, plug them in, plug the transmitter into a socket and into the sound source (XM Radio), then turn on the speakers. One remote control works with all of the speakers. A note: the speaker must first be physically be turned on by pressing the speaker's on button. The remote control will adjust the volume and turn it off--but it will not turn it on. There is plenty of volume and walls or distances within the home have not reduced or interfered with the volume on the most-remote speaker. However, I have not explored the maximum distance of the speakers from the source by taking a speaker outside.  All-in-all, I am very satisfied.  I have noticed one speaker makes a popping sound sometimes.  I am not sure why that happens, but it is minor and infrequent.",positive,positive

"First off, this item is EXPENSIVE.  The profit margin on these things must be huge.  If money is no object, fine, but if you are cost-conscious, consider exploring less-expensive alternatives.  I have used version in the $30 range that work pretty well, and frankly there is not a ton of difference as you go up the scale.<br /><br />Secondly, I will say this is my favorite of the various keyboards I've tried (some purchased, some provided free of charge for review).  The keyboard is spacious, the keys are VERY nice to press.  Everything works perfectly.  The iPad fits in sturdily but is still easy to take out; the magnet is firm.  The viewing angle is good.  Everything is great.  I would say it's the first I've used where everything seems just right.<br /><br />Now, the flaws.  First, it is larger than others I've used, i.e. it's larger than the iPad and does not fit snugly.  This can help protect the iPad better (though if you want protection, you need some kind of case/cover, not just a keyboard case/cover).  It also allows a larger typing surface.  But, it is less compact.<br /><br />The second flaw is the serious one for me.  The keyboard itself never goes to sleep unless you close the case.  Right now, in fact, I have it sitting here open in front of me, as I often do, and despite not having used it for an hour, the keyboard is still awake.  This is not a big deal for the keyboard, really, as the battery in it lasts ages.  However, as long as the keyboard is on, Bluetooth will also be on, on your iPad, and as long as Bluetooth is on and connected to something, the iPad battery drains faster.  If the keyboard went to sleep after 15 minutes like all the others do, then the iPad/keyboard would disconnect from each other, and the iPad would not be wasting power on Bluetooth.<br /><br />You can turn Bluetooth off yourself.  You can also close the case.  Both of these are a pain, and because of this, I will probably go back to one of my previous cases, despite actually preferring this keyboard physically to all others.  It's a real shame!<br /><br />Great quality, overpriced (as most of them are), lack of auto-sleep when open.  The auto-sleep problem is enough to drop it to three stars for me (the price being what dropped it from five to four).",neutral,positive

So as soon as she saw this keyboard with its ability to wirelessly connect to a variety of devices, she wanted it. And, as you can tell from the title of this review, she was not at all disappointed. The pairing was easy. The keyboard itself is light enough to be easily portable. The keys feel good to her when she's typing. And the colors are pleasing to her eye? What's not to like about this lovely keyboard?",positive,positive
"This adapter isn't bad. I had some issues installing the drivers, but once I ran the install with the adapter unplugged and then plugged it in, it took off just fine. The only issues are it can be unreliable. It gets hot to the touch and loses internet, you must unplug it. Let it cool off. Plug it back in and back on the net you go. But for 3 dollars? not bad at all.",neutral,positive

"This device needs a TV, electrical power, a wifi network with broadband internet connection to work. It takes a few minutes to set up in the home network but its MAC address is easily found on one screen and the screens to input passwords and to connect to Amazon are both less awkward to use than much of my experience with previous devices.<br /><br />Once either the Firefox browser or the proprietary Silk browser from Amazon is downloaded it becomes an internet device with better capability than a smart phone, plus that huge TV screen. Web searches trend to those slimmed down sites you can put on a smart phone, but you can input regular URLs too. I'm in the process of collecting data so I can listen to my European news and music stations; you'd be surprised how much Euro internet media is free, plus there is the bonus of not having news filtered through the US network goggles. I'm taken by the youtube app, which is basically just a browser bookmark.<br /><br />Amazon also has a lot of free things for Prime users, particularly movies and TV shows. It is the rough equivalent to basic cable, plus Prime gives you free book shipping, other bells and whistles. Damned site cheaper than basic satellite plus equipment rental. Apps like HBO et cetera are free to download, but the subscription fee the HBO pirates stick you with is no more than if you'd had cable or satellite. And most of the third party subscription packages have the same expensive added crap as on cable. (I mean really, I'm an Amazon customer. I can read. I don't have time to watch idiots banging their heads together pushing a ball around on fake grass and I surely don't have time to watch home shopping networks, porn or the other crap.)<br /><br />I especially like the fact that this device can play my Amazon music library, but there is a big glaring flaw in the system. It will only readily play the electronic  music stored in my Amazon account, not the Amazon purchased CDs I've put into my iTunes library, nor other CDs for that matter. (There is an inconvenient way for the Fire Stick to play iTunes from my local computer, but not iCloud. This involves enabling local file sharing, setting up Apple airplay, fiddling with iTunes settings, buying a third party Fire Stick app, setting up the app.) Amazon and Apple apparently don't believe in getting along and allowing the user to easily and quickly merge their libraries. Shame on you both. That's why this review is four instead of five stars.<br /><br />Oh, yes the remote. If there is problem opening it, a baby can get into it in about a minute, but watch out that they don't eat the batteries. Speaking of eating batteries, the remote batteries don't last long at all. And for me Alexa is a waste since I never use it. There should be a way of hardware disabling it so it doesn't contribute to battery wastage.<br /><br />After several months I'm adding the comment that I've downgraded my review from 4 to  3 stars over a variation of the same issue, battery wastage.  The remote tends to draw heavily on batteries so that every click weakens them. This is particularly annoying if you like to do media searches on the device rather than logging on to your computer to do them there. What happens is you are clicking, perhaps trying to pause a video or go back to home, basically any click. Suddenly everything freezes and the only way out is to open up the damned remote, remove one of the batteries and then replace it. Apparently the problem is a momentary voltage drop because you can replace it with the same battery. I don't know the specific reason but it is really annoying. You will notice the older the batteries get the more frequent are the stops. You begin to feel like the rat in the Skinner box, click x number of times and the remote will reward you.",neutral,positive
"Got my drive in 3 days...awesome! Anyway, I installed the new drive in no time and noticed right away that there is no plug for the CD cable form my older Audgy Zs 2 Plat sound card so,I cuess I wont be playing CD's from this drive.Another thing which is more a little pest then a big deal is the nero 8 software....there is no provision for a custom install and you have to install the whole thing....There are some ""boxes"" to tick to assoseate file types with the nero software and a deslect all button...but it really didnt work.If you are into photography as I am,having to wait for nero 8 to open every Jpeg is a hassle...the way to fix this back to normal is to bring up a Jepg's properties and change what it opens with back to default.Another thing with the nero software; my runing processes went from 32 to 47(I like to run a lean machine)so now I have to open my task manager and close out the extra programs (MSconfig) doesnt list the processes.

Bought this for my mom so she had one device to stream and play discs.<br /><br />CPU is vastly under powered and the interface navigation is quite slow / clunky.<br /><br />Streaming apps buffer and resolution is poor vs. a standard Roku 2 sitting right next to it connected to the same network.<br /><br />Device also had auto update turned on but it never updated.

No response from the remote or buttons on the unit.  Lowered to 1 star.,negative,negative
"***UPDATE***<br />Letters began to rub off after about 6 months of constant use during 40 hour work weeks.  Initially thought to be a permanent solution is just a cover-up that wears off too.  If you're looking for something short-term, then this is for you. But if you are like me, looking for something I don't have to change for the life of the keyboard, look elsewhere. 2 stars for looking good and lasting for a little while.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />My Logitech Wave keyboard is abused daily by my fingers, wearing out the letters I use often.  Being an engineer and having to use CAD, the S, F, D, C, V, and other keys get pressed multiple times a day.  Having the letters missing just bothered me to the core.  I decided to get some stickers to at least have the letters show again.  Although these were more glossy than the actual keys, they get the job done with replacing the faded letters. I rather have that than no letters at all. They stick very well, and seems like they'll be durable enough to last with my constant poking. Works well for what I wanted it to do, and my Wave keyboard looks like something again.",negative,positive

"Updated review 9/12/17: Ended up upgrading to a better tablet. I just got tired of the cheapish feel of it, but I do highly recommend the Fire HD for reading or just a tablet for your kids to enjoy.<br /><br />I like it for what it is. I was hoping to get more of a tablet feel, but the more I mess with it the more I'm coming to realize that it's a reader with a few extras. My main issue is the amazon app store. The apps are TERRIBLE  and very limited. After a bit of research, I was able to download the google play store, so things are much better. The touch screen is a bit unreliable. I bought a stylus to get around that issue, but I still sometimes have to hit the link, app or whatever a few times before it opens up.<br /><br />Anyway, I don't want to bash it too much, because like I said, I was hoping it would be more than what it promised. I will use it and when I can, I'll get a real tablet and use this strictly as a reader with a few extras.",neutral,positive

"I've been looking for a portable bluetooth speaker that sounds good and is portable. Just received Tribit XSound Go today, and really surprised at the size, portability, and build quality. It's small enough to carry everywhere, connects to Bluetooth devices effortlessly, and stay connected. It came 50% charged and took less than 2 hours to fully charge.  I can’t say about the claim of 24 hour battery life, but I’m optimistic. The thing I’m surprised is the sound quality for its  small size. It has two speakers and a passive radiator, and they produce clear and balanced sound, the base is there but not muddled or overpowering like Sony XB 10.  Good sound quality for its size and purpose. I have tried other bluetooth speakers like Sony XB10, Anker Soundcore Motion Q., Ontz, Insignia, JBL Flip 2, but I like the clear and balanced sound with adequate presence of bass of Tribit and will be keeping it.<br />Update after 3 months: bought another one but it was producing hissing sound, Amazon did a quick replacement, but the replacement is producing crackling sound from one of the speaker, so need to return it too.

"Unfortunately I cannot give Sony a Zero Star or less because they deserve it ... I purchased one of their Android 4K TV's and spend over $1800 ... It is incredible how buggy it is (most apps don't work, frequent restarts required, and in many cases they don't solve the problem ... but the good news is the Internet proves that you are not alone :-( and Sony Support does not care) ... and what is even better their engineers and support does not care ... they suggest to wait for the next upgrade which will ruin your TV evening. At this point I think their engineers don't know what they are doing ... Sony enforces system upgrades on their consumers at prime TV time ... and in comparison even corporate IT departments wouldn't do that. So if you buy any Sony TV be prepared not to use it when you really want to use it because their engineers will enforce a 30 -60 + minute upgrade on you when they think it is appropriate ...<br /><br />Go with a brand that exists in the 21st century and avoid Sony. They are outdated.<br /><br />Ending my review on a positive note  ...  Sony at least waited with the upgrade until the evening after Superbowl ...<br /><br />If you have a choice avoid Sony products ... and especially TV's",negative,positive

"I installed this unit in a 2004 Subaru Forester for my wife. The mirror unit uses 4 clamps plus 2 Velcro straps to attach to the front of the factory mirror. The factory mirror does not droop with the additional weight of this mirror. There is a power connector at the top center of the mirror. You have a choice of 2 different power cords. One plugs into a standard 12v outlet. The other has leads to hard wire into the backup lighting circuit. I like the design of the mounting bracket that the camera is attached to. It allows you to remove the top 2 bolts from the rear license plate and slip the bracket behind the plate. The camera slips over the front of the plate and clicks into 4 or 5 different positions.<br /><br />This paragraph is for anyone that might have this car. On the Subaru there is somewhat limited clearance between the camera and the hatch release. I bent the bracket down slightly and there is enough room to get your hand in and release the hatch. I was able to avoid drilling the 1/2 inch hole required to feed the wire inside. You need to remove the plastic trim inside the hatch and the plastic trim piece outside that has the Subaru letters across the back. The 2 lamps for the license plate feed through a molded rubber coupling to the inside. By unplugging the lighting connector and removing the wiring I was able to trim enough rubber away from the coupling to slip in the camera wire. The camera plugs into the wireless transmitter which I attached to the inside of the hatch using the supplied wire ties. The power wire to the wireless transmitter needs to be routed to one of the backup lamps. This took some doing as the wire had to be fished through the rubber accordion coupling from the hatch to the upper body of the car. I used the right tail lamp and partially removed trim along the top and right rear of the hatch area.<br /><br />Initially I used the 12v outlet for the mirror assembly. As others have noted the wireless receiver can pick up stray wireless signals as you drive around. Not too bad in the burbs but when I was driving around Queens, N.Y. the unit was flashing the parking guidelines on every block. I was amused to see images from wireless security cameras but after a while it gets distracting. You would really need to tap the power button and turn off the unit in congested surroundings. The image is decent and clear most of the time. I don't see a lot of static although I could certainly envision situations where the wireless might have interference. You do have to wait a few seconds after putting the car in reverse for the image to appear.<br /><br />In the end I decided to hard wire the mirror unit to the backup lighting circuit so it would be fully automated like a factory unit. I was unable to locate the wire up front for the backup lighting so I extended the wire they supplied and ran it back to the same tail light. Definitely a lot more work. It also negates the advantage of the wireless setup as I had to run a wire the length of the car anyhow. If you don't mind turning the power on and off at the mirror or if you are in wide open spaces this is probably a non-issue.<br /><br />My wife is satisfied with the unit. It's definitely an add-on safety feature and not really a substitute for looking behind you. For us, the mirror tint is OK for both daytime and nighttime driving. I think that given the low cost the manufacturer has done a pretty good job of assembling this package. The camera bracket design, the mirror clamp, the wire splices and wire wraps pretty much take care of it. A longer power wire to the mirror would have been nice and they might consider a fully wired unit as well where power and camera are integrated in a single long cable.<br /><br />Update: 4-30-12. Water must have gotten in the camera as it stopped working. Now all I get is red-blue-green splotches on the screen. Will try to get a replacement. What a pain. Have lowered rating.<br /><br />Update: 11-2-12. Since replacing camera it has been working just fine with no further issues. Added back star.<br /><br />Update: 8-25-13. Still working fine.<br /><br />Update: 4-29-15. Still working!<br /><br />Update: 4-1-16. Still going.",neutral,positive

"Very flimsy, certainly will not stand up to Northeast winters. However, it does not have the range they claim.

Tried different cables and even moved it  a few times. PingBingDing is a PieceOfCrap. This antenna may be light weight but it bends too easy and even the plastic is cheap.",negative,positive

Picture quality is okay.  The thing that really bothers me about this TV  is when you turn it on it does not revert to what ever mode you were in when you turned it off.  So every time I turn it on with the Direct TV remote I have to use the TCL remote just to select the source you want to use.  This is a pain in the ass.  I have other smart TV's and they all open to the selection screen but after a few seconds if you do not pick another source it will go to the last source and resume programing from that source.  This system is to much like watching content on a computer.  So if you like that solution this system will be just for you.  I don't like it at all.  I seems in this day and age you could select a mode.  Also the remote is terrible.  I have yet to figure out how to get close captioning on this tv.  Again for the price you can not beat it.  I need to get a TV for out on my deck and I think that is where this TV will wind up and I will go with something else in my great room.,neutral,positive

"Although I was concerned by some of the reviews of the operation,remote and reliability I decided to give it a try. It it true that the plastic protective wrap is a bit irritating to remove at least it should signify you have a brand new unit. The unit I received has a software  date of Sept. 2017 The unit is connected with rabbit ears, a 22&#34; HP monitor, extended cable headset and a 64GB Cruzer flash drive for DVR recorfing. The unit auto-scan logged 22 channels Reception and recording are excellent if you have signal strength above 60. If not re-adjust it or get a better antenna,The Time shift feature is very handy if your watching is interrupted and automatically deletes the recording when you catch up and finish watching.RPG works as well as any I have seen. When viewing photos recorded on the flash drive pressing hold will step through a sequence of higher resolution views that should please pixel peepers, Although the remote has a lot of buttons it is quite easy to get used to and it does not seem to have a distance problem. As far as reliability goes I left the unit on standby, while not in use during my 30 day Amazon return period for &#34;burn-in&#34; and now just unplug it when not in use. Hopefully it will continue to work for sometime.  At the moment I am very satisfied with this set-up.<br />Update 4/14/20<br />I bought another to replace the first whicj failed after 21/2 years. The new unit is stuck on 24hr format in EPG and is irritating my wife no end,definitely not a fan of ZULU time. Waiting for an email response from supportbefore returning.",neutral,positive
"Zipper tabs/pulls fell off after few weeks. The leather is good quality but wears after a year. Very functional which is why I still like it.

The way the arms fold really only benefit hard to see ppl who want to move the screen close to your face.  So, why buy this?  1.  to have 2 monitors on stand.  2.  To make it easier to clean the table.<br /><br />Lastly, it does have a slight wobble, but unsure if this is normal with monitor stands.",neutral,negative
"Thanks to an order mess up I actually got this TV instead of the one I wanted which was the non smart version of this TV which are identical minus the apps. This TV's is large, aesthetically pleasing to the eye. Has 4 HDMI ports which I LOVE, however the reason this is getting 3 stars is because of one huge flaw and I know this is not a defect because there are too many reviews I have seen between this site and the LE600U (non smart version same size)... The dubbing is off by about .25 seconds. I normally wouldn't have noticed this but since I had read the review I started to look for it and it's REALLY in my face. I mean it's not like it's a huge difference but I can see it and I find myself focusing on it and it is really hard to watch shows with a lot of lip movement because I find myself checking the voice to visual match up and it drives my absolutely insane. Had this been a different situation and I had a way to return to the TV and have the same mix up in my favor I would choosea  different TV. On another note, the color, brightness and contrast settings are definitely there and you DO have to tweak them because this TV looks terrible out of the box. Also, I have found that the FILM MODE which runs the movies/ picture at 24FPS is really hard to tolerate especially with anything animated. My cable input for example even with FILM MODE turned off and motion assist turned off it still to some degree does it when the PS3 and XBOX with the setting off are fine. The auto brightness of the TV is a nice feature and only turn it on at night because its quicker to push one button once then hold down the turn brightness down button. All in all with the TV set up and picture settings adjusted the picture does look great with the exception of the lag in the dubbing. The sound I will admit does suck. But it doesn't sound horrible like most people say about this TV. Don't expect Bose quality speakers on a tv. Doesn't happen. They do the trick. My advice is to view this TV or its non smart counterpart in a store before buying this so you can see the dubbing lag. It may make or break this TV for you. Good luck.",neutral,positive

"I don't really like in-ear buds and use around ear headphones at home. This seemed like a decent on the go solution, but they seem like more trouble than they're worth. I haven't had issues with disconnecting or not having native English voice prompts, but they just don't seem to ""do it"" for me.<br /><br />By nature of the fact they fit on the outside of the ear, they're not the loudest even at max volume. The design is nice because it allows me to hear people talking without having to pause the music or remove the headphones, but I wouldn't consider these as possessing any noise canceling properties.<br /><br />They don't fit snug either and if I manage to get them into a position where they don't move around a bit, they'll begin causing discomfort after a brief period. I feel like I'm constantly adjusting them, which leads to me triggering the very sensitive touch function. I'm not positive how the touch functionality works, as it sometimes pauses the music as expected but often randomly controls volume.<br /><br />They work and everybody's different, but they're ultimately too touchy, don't fit well and aren't loud enough.",neutral,negative

"I bought these in June of 2012. I burned some movies and all worked well. Then about 5 months ago, I made two back-up discs from items on my pc. One disc is mostly videos; the other is a variety of files. I have successfully accessed both throughout the year. Yesterday, I tried to access files on the ""variety"" back-up but found that although the files are there, none will open. Each is listed as ""corrupted"" when I try to open it. Some are from Microsoft Word, some are pdf files, others are from various e readers, some are mp3's, some are jpg's. The only thing they have in common now is that each and every one is reported as corrupted. These are not RE-write discs so that cannot be the problem. In fact, I cannot find any info about this problem so my conclusion is that the disc is corrupted. I've tried Word restore programs to see if I can access that data, but nothing has worked. At the moment, my other back-up disc is working correctly. Of course, back up, then back up again, then back up again.<br />What are the chances it will happen to you? Very slim, I'd say. However, it obviously does happen. I purchased Verbatim just because I did trust the brand.<br /><br />EDIT: In all fairness to the media, I ran a disc scan with my old Nero 8. It showed no problems. FWIW, I'm using the LG Electronics WH12LS39K M-Disc 12X Internal SATA Blu-Ray Rewriter. If anyone has any idea what else could cause all the files to be ""corrupt,"" I would like to know so I can avoid future events.

"This is the worst TV my family has ever owned, and we've owned a lot.  There's really nothing good to say about it.

It kept reporting 200GB for this card as total capacity even if I added additional cards to the board and also when the total storage was under 2TB.  I assume it is the revision of iFlash Quad I have but still... it seems like a red flag for now unless someone finds a workaround or there's another revision of the iFlash Quad.<br /><br />So I can't knock the card for that.... but in case you're looking to see if you can hit or break 2TB in your iPod Classic.... you may be able to but probably not yet.  (and yes, I did things like clean the partition table off the card like I always do... and total capacity in DISKPART was still 200GB....  and no, the card is not fake... I currently have 183GB on the card now on my tablet and it's doing just fine).",positive,positive
"I was using this to replace a 10 year old laptop bag. The functionality and features were largely the same, although this item is a fraction of the cost of my last bag. The only thing that I can’t get used to is the small zipper compartment in the back. Instead of zipping around the pocket (like the large pocket), or horizontally (as most school backpacks), this zips vertically for some inexplicable reason. Every time I need to get something out of there I’m worried all my things are going to fall out and so I stopped using it although. That’s inconvenient and I’m now trying to find new “homes” for all the things I used to keep in the pocket. Everything else about this bag is so well made and such a value, that it feels silly being so disappointed in one small pocket that isn’t even holding my laptop!",neutral,negative

"I bought 2 Asus Transformers at another store for $199 each for my mom & I.  I was so excited because they're rarely that cheap especially brand new.  We use our tablets daily.  Exactly a week later my moms wouldn't power on.  The power button pushed in permanently due to my moms trying to get it on.  I exchanged it for her a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 10.1. Works perfectly. Mines wouldn't power on 3days later.  I couldn't believe it. I had all my stuff loaded & bought about $100 of accessories.  Fortunately I rcvd a full refund.  I loved the keyboard but something is horribly wrong with the power.  Also, the storage is only about 9Gb for use out the box...don't know how they could sell it as 32gb...Never buying Asus again!!!",negative,negative
"This was our second one that we purchased.  The first one bubbled up so bad that the lower right corner of the screen was unusable unless you tapped really hard on it several times.  The second time was better, but because the screen fits all the way to the edge of glass on my 6th generation ipad, the case edges are really close to the glass.  Would I purchase it again? Probably.

"BLUF:  I've long ago installed a 2-(Clearstream) antenna setup in the 8'+ mark of my attic.  I currently get about 30 channels with those (including simulcast), but I could only get the local PBS (4 simulcast channels) with this in the same configuration.  Plenty of details below, if you're interested:<br /><br />The construction and design of this is rather good (except that I don't know that it actually works that well, or at least not to my expectations).  It's an engineering marvel in itself that all this stuff could fit into the small box it came in.  They give you plenty of extras including a long and short Cat6 cable (although I prefer thicker - even if it is just cladding, you can expect thicker cables are less likely CCA -  cables with compression connectors and without sharp bends for the best installation possible).  And you get a good rod for mounting, all for a fairly inexpensive price tag.<br /><br />The two Clearstream antennae setup I have costs probably more than $200 by the time I bought the amp separately.  One is UHF and one is VHF.  Those claim 70+ mile range when used outside, while this one claims 150 mile range, but has less gain.  I actually thought it might work better anyway, just because my other setup has not worked as well lately, and I assume it is because they've been paring down the frequency range for television and I thought maybe antenna design has changed, and maybe it became cheaper to get a better signal.  Plus, I saw one of these before under a different brand name, so I thought this new, smaller design may be a thing.<br /><br />Anyway, I don't understand the 150-mile claims.  The others exaggerate, but not too awful much.  I know I don't have it outside, but I should get a comparable signal for a comparable setup.<br /><br />Recommend tvfooldotcom to research.  Highly recommend cutting the cord.  This is better than nothing, but recommend getting the best equipment you can find and have room for.  Price apparently matters, at least to some degree.<br /><br />Oh...this one does move if you use the remote, which is an interesting concept, but may only work well if you have a TV that can ""add channels"" rather than one where you have to scan from scratch every time (My two Sony TVs allow you to add channels, and I always get better reception with them than my two Samsung TVs that do not allow you to add channels).  If you can't add channels and you want to move the antenna from one direction to the other, you'll likely have to rescan with each move.<br /><br />I did try hooking this straight up to one TV, not going through a grounding block or splitter, just in case that's what it would take to work (because the gain is not very high), but no dice.  It does have two outputs, so you can avoid a splitter if you only have two TVs.<br /><br />The remote for moving the antenna is IR, so if your amp is not near your TV, you'll either have to run to the basement to adjust or have some kind of IR repeater setup.<br /><br />I don't like the size or look of the amp power supply or the power injector box.<br /><br />This has slightly wider - but very similar - frequency ranges than my legacy antennae, so I don't think things have changed so much with digital OTA TV.<br /><br />I've always been happy with the setup I have after putting in some serious research.  It cost more than this, but not enough to think twice about considering I'll never pay for TV again.  However, I'm still not sure why I've had a degraded signal recently.  Regardless, this newer antenna style did not fix the problem.",neutral,positive

"This boom-arm was great while it lasted.  I used it to hold my standard iPad while in bed.  But it only lasted a couple of months of normal use before the flexible boom arm broke at the base.  The metal interior of the arm snapped Frustrating.  I didn’t move it around or abuse it at all.  I chose a spot, attached it, and didn’t move the base around at all once I found the right spot.  It just couldn’t handle everyday, regular use.  It broke right inside the support piece that screws onto the base to secure the base.  It is a design flaw.  The where the arm meets the base is where most torque is absorbed.  There is a collar extending onto the flexible arm, but it is short, loose, and made out of cheap plastic.  The base support of the flexible arm should be stronger and not made out of cheap plastic.",negative,negative

"As with most glass screen protectors, I worry about breakage during shipping, it is a pain for all involved and delays the end user getting to use the product. Luckily Anker packaged my screen protector very well and it arrived in pristine condition.<br /><br />The main reason I went with a glass protector over plastic is the &#34;finger feel&#34; I really don't like how plastic sort of &#34;grips&#34; your finger when you slide it across the surface of the device. Luckily with this glass, it feels as if I am using the iPad with a totally bare OEM screen. Its really almost like I don't even have it on.<br /><br />Time will tell how it holds up to scratches but with my normal daily media use, it has zero scratches so far so it looks like we have a winner. As for installation, glass vs plastic is massively different. All I had to do was line up two edges then slowly lower the glass down. I finished with a little cardboard squeegee to get the edges tight. No air bubbles to speak of.<br /><br />I was really blown away at just how easy this is to install. The sticker &#34;hinges&#34; they gave you really make this COMPLETELY effortless.<br /><br />Overall great glass protector for the iPad Air 2.",positive,positive

Even when you aren't touching it, the thing will dismount itself for no apparent reason.

Battery life is acceptable and I didn't have any issues with it.<br /><br />The one strange tweak I never could figure out and never did manage to fix was that it wouldn't let me access the sound settings.

"Works so far, easily more reliable than the Linksys it replaced even after only a week. Having said that, the signal strength isn't what I expected or hoped for.

I've noticed a few pauses when connecting to web resources that I don't recall previously. If I determine them related to causes other than the AP, I'll revise my rating upward.  Setup was easy using the included tools and web interface. I configured it to AP mode until I can move the cable modem to where this lives. No issues doing so using the web interface.

(Running fans on high) The ARGB worked perfectly with my Gigabyte B450M DS3H Wifi motherboard. They look sweeeet. I didnt attach  the PWM header to my motherboard to adjust fan speeds, (i was just kinda sketched) so idk how well that works, but using the remote for the fan speed is fine for me. Maybe i’ll use it in the future and update this review, but for now these are great budget ARGB fans! Also, just to note, these fans have proprietary connectors that attach to the included hub, which you then have to attach the hub to a SATA cable for power, and then  it also connects to the PWM header and ARGB pins on your motherboard (if you use either of those control options instead of the remote).<br />If you get these btw, to get the motherboard control to turn on for the RGB, you have to double tap the power button on the remote. You can always switch back to the remote control afterwards with another double press tho. The instructions aren’t the best, but i also didnt expect them to be.<br />Update: after about a week of working perfectly, my fans randomly turned off and ever since, the fans dont spin quite as fast which has cut the airflow almost completely. The lights and everything still works, but the lack of airflow means i’ll probably have to replace these fans. I’ll try to contact support in the meantime, but for now, be weary.",neutral,positive

"So I have this situated under my desk. I have my computer, both monitors, a WiFi switch, and a desk lamp hooked up, so five things overall. I try to keep the computer, one monitor and the switch hooked up on battery backup, and the router & monitor both have power adapters built into their plugs. So I have to carefully arrange the plugs so that those three things fit along the same strip. The adapters stick out from the sides as well, so with this sitting just above the floor they're still easily bumped. Mind you, I have the other monitor and the desk lamp plugged into the non-battery side, and both of those are adapter plugs.

"If my J7 wasn't so glitchy, I'd still be using it but after the last OS upgrade, both cellular and WiFi glitch (turn off and on randomly). Even after factory reset, that phone is now a game phone only.<br /><br />Regarding the S7, sure it's a faster phone with more space to store files, but when I check email for about a half hour and my battery goes down 20%, I'm unhappy.<br /><br />Perhaps that's how the new phones operate. Perhaps I was spoiled with the long battery life of the Neo J7. Either way, I should have purchased the A7 as I originally planned. I didn't because of the bulky size, but after putting a case on my S7, it's roughly the same. I should have gotten the A7!!<br /><br />I haven't tested the water resistance and hope I never do.<br /><br />Overall, it's a decent phone with a terrible battery life. I don't not recommend it, but I do suggest that you keep a charger nearby... you're going to need it.",neutral,positive

"If you're looking for this product for call center work, forget about it. Go with Logitech headphones of some sort. They are not only lightweight and durable, but have a mute button as well(I'm sure Amazon sells Logitech, so go with those). I don't think there was anything about this headset that wasn't a train wreck for me. To begin with: the headset is extremely bulky, and after a few hours of use your ears ache because there isn't enough room for your ear and the headphone set against it. They're heavy, and you can feel the neck strain and the headache after an hour or two of use.<br /><br />The mic mutes when you push it up beside your head, which is fine. Until you try to pull it back down again. In which case, don't be trying to use your mouse with the other hand. It takes one hand holding the headphones, and the other hand pulling down the mic in order to keep it from toppling off of your head.<br /><br />The sound is good, but the headset isn't worth the hassle. And don't drop it or bend it even a little. If you do, the mic stops working! Don't waste your money!",negative,positive
"Not quite DEEP BASS- but still sound very good.<br /><br />I think the best things going for these headphones:<br /><br />They are very light weight- easy to wear for extended periods of time.<br /><br />The battery lasts nearly forever- I charge them once a week and wear them at my desk at work M-F. I'd say 30-40 hours of play time from a full charge.<br /><br />Comfortable- band is slim and lightweight- cup pads are really soft, all the plastic is covered in &#34;soft touch&#34; rubberized coating.<br /><br />Affordable- sound every bit as good as a $299 pair of Beats by ---  look pretty sharp too.<br /><br />Included aux cable and charging cable are pretty nice as well.",positive,positive

"I heard rave reviews of this router so jumped right in.  It is easy to set-up with good instructions.  My reason for only 3 stars is the lack of distance that it is able to send signal.  In a large open room with no obstructions it will not send to my laptop less than 30' away.  I use it with a USB760 Verizon stick ...so I'm stuck here where the signal is the best in the house...and that is why I bought a router!!!  When I had HughesNet dish my old router powered the whole house, through walls, upstairs, downstairs...that is what I was expecting, or at least something more than 3' range.",neutral,positive

"Bought this for a backup of my wife's desktop computer using Norton Ghost. I like that it has NO power supply, runs entirely on the power supplied by the USB2 port. Plugged it in, Windows XP immediately recognized it and installed it, and Ghost was able to see it and use it with no problem. It's very small and looks great, and the price was right ($49.99 from Amazon, no tax, free shipping).<br /><br />I opted for the 250GB version as my wife's computer has only a 160GB hard drive, so I saw no reason to spend any additional money to get a larger external backup drive. However, you can get a much larger version for only a few bucks more. I've seen the 500GB version of this drive advertised locally for $59.95. Still, if this is large enough for your needs, it's a great deal.",positive,positive
"Overall, this backpack is a fine design with convenient storage compartments.  However, even after having been on the road for several weeks, the item still won't stand properly because of the manner in which it was shipped.  The seller bends the item in the middle and then tightly binds it to make as small a package as possible.  Because of this, the item has a permanent bend in the middle and stands like an old man with a back problem.  If it weren't for this issue, I would rate it a ""5"".",neutral,positive

"My rating for the Hiletgo dev boards I have purchased, most Hiletgo products in fact, are all 5-star.  I would recommend them to anyone.  This is why I take issue with and am confused by the deception Hiletgo is using.  This listing and the 5-star ratings and reviews are for a dev board that had one of the ESP-WROOM-32S variants, but at some point that MCU was switched out for a ""D"" variant. The ""D"" variant should have been given a new listing, an honest company would have given it a new listing, but Hiletgo chose further deception and confusion, as if there wasn't already enough confusion associated with ""S"" variant on the original board (see early reviews).  While I am writing this review both the images and the written description on this listing have conflicting information and are a mix of both variants.  It can't be both, and which one it is DOES MATTER.  The specs are different, they each have not so subtle differences in capabilities.  These differences may not be relevant to most, but that does not make them irrelevant, nor does it justify falsely claiming one has earned the rating of the other.  I won't go so far as to say this is fraud or even that it is a deceptive sales practice, it's not either, though close.  And, as a listing for a Development Board rather than an Evaluation Board, I suspect it isn't even a violation of Amazons' policy against product switching in listings. But that doesn't mean it isn't breaking the spirit of that policy, which is intended to prevent positive ratings of one product to appear as if they are for another which this does.",neutral,negative
Highlights of this set are that you get everything you need to get started with a set of 2 light sticks that are easy to set up and take up signficantly less space than your standard soft box set. I think the light quality was okay coming out of these for the price and it was great that it was bi color and includes some color gels. Super convenient also to have the remote which worked quite well. Unfortunately in order to get the good angles with the lights it does cause it to be quite unstable which at times can feel a little scary. These do get quite bright and it is much easier to control this light since it is so thin.<br /><br />Really like that this set is easy to setup and reliatively small foot print. wish the light stands were more stable (can be a inexpensive swap if you do have light stands). For a starter set i am super happy with this set.,positive,positive
"I've been using the BrainDriver since October of 2018.  I'm 46 years old and have lived with chronic depression for years.  I've never taken meds for my condition.  I've always just dealt with it.<br /><br />Since starting tDCS with the BrainDriver my mood has improved.  It was a very subtle effect for me, and it took a couple weeks before I was sure that I was actually feeling it.  But one of the first indicators was that I was more motivated to get projects done around the house that I've been putting off for a while.  And in general I do feel happier most of the time.  Like I said, it's subtle for me.  There are still times when I get depressed, even entire days when things happen and I get down.  But overall, my baseline seems to be a little happier.<br /><br />I use the anode F3, cathode Fp2 electrode placement.  And I treat once every two to three days, which seems to be enough for me.  It is a bit difficult to know if you've got the electrodes in exactly the right place.  But there are several diagrams on the net that are helpful.<br /><br />Edit:  I forgot to mention- I also suffer from extreme social anxiety and panic disorder and the BrainDriver has helped alleviate both of those conditions, thankfully.",positive,negative
"I have several covers from Verso and some are better than others. There's nothing wrong with this one, but nothing great. If you like the appearance of this one, it will probably meet your expectations.<br /><br />Some of the Verso covers have pockets on the inside. This one doesn't. Some competing brands attach the Kindle using elastic bands on top, and plastic inserts on the bottom. This one uses elastic straps all around. That's not necessarily a bad thing and will hold things just as well or possibly better. But it's a bit more awkward putting the Kindle into it. If you plan to leave the Kindle in there, it's a one time issue. If you plan to take the Kindle out and put it in regularly, you might find it awkward. But it's quite practical to leave the Kindle in the case.<br /><br />The spine is flexible and allows you to fold the cover back behind the kindle. It's also flexible enough that it will let the cover wiggle from side to side when closed. It's not a deal breaker, but it makes it seem lower in quality than it actually is. It's reasonably well made.<br /><br />The good part is the design, and you wouldn't be looking at it if you didn't want a composition notebook look. It has the added bonus of taking the look and feel to the inside with ruled lines. If you want something with this look, I can't say that the negatives are strong enough to rule this out. I'd also feel fine about giving this as a gift to somebody whose tastes were along the lines of this item.<br /><br />This is listed as an accessory for the Kindle Fire, and that's what I used it with. But the manufacturer says it's also for the Kindle Keyboard, and a variety of others from Samsung, Sony, HTC, etc. that are listed on the lightwedge website.",neutral,positive

"This is a small unit that goes under your cabinet. We have it under our kitchen cabinet and I use it while I'm cooking or just having breakfast by myself. The image is sharp and the sound is honest enough. It is not a surround system kind of sound and the image is not the sharpest I've seen, but it is fair. We bought a house 4 years ago and the former owners left the unit in because they didn't want the trouble of unscrewing it -- and probably having to repair the cabinet :-)<br />I'm not sure how old this unit is, but it is still going.

"I bought this computer and used it with my business for a while.  It performed and still performs fasntastically if you modify it.  As others stated, the battery performance is horrible.  Plugged into power, it operates fast and efficiently.  I do not use the keypad though, I added a Logitech DiNovo keyboard and a Logitech marble mouse.  When I had to add other USB devices because of the business use, I added the panel that allows up to 4 additional devices.  The Sony handled this extra software working all at the same time with ease.  With long hours, the screen is indeed very easy on the eyes.<br /><br />Just recently, however, after 3 years of use, the vertical lines are appearing.  First one on the right side and then one on the left.  It does not show on a white background though.  This is disappointing to me because I like to watch movies on the notebook from Netflix's instant play feature.  I will live with it for a while before I research repairs.  I would hate to be without this computer because it is so good at speed and multitasking.<br /><br />However, having been through other hardware venders, like Dell and HP, I would still buy a Sony because the Dell was excruciatingly slow with a fan motor that sounds like a jet.

"Even after rinsing the glasses with water to get any possible dust and debris and spraying with lens cleaning spray, these cloths after one use leave smudges behind.

If I knew who made that one, I'd buy more of those instead of this mess!<br />My search continues.  But I was also told by an optical salesperson that this type of material is notorious for laying down smudges.  Part of it is that they aren't really thick enough to draw anything away from the surface of the cloth and also to keep your already oily fingers from coming in contact with the lens.  The promotional cloth I mentioned earlier is thicker; and it feels like some mini squeegee action is going on when I use it.

"These are good.  I think the big sell is if you want to be able to control things on an i-device or use them for phone conversations.<br /><br />From a headphone quality, they are fairly light, and the on-ear fit is comfortable - I can easily wear them all day and I have a slightly bigger head than the average person.  Its nice with the single cable that unplugs from the headphones - my favorite thing about these.  The cable is a bit awkward though.  It's a lot thicker than expected and the little control button / mic part is at an awkward spot.  I wear a collard shirt for work and the button gets caught which is pretty annoying.  I flipped the cable upside down since I don't plan to use this for voice and I don't have an i-device.  I might buy a separate cable and eliminate this one.<br /><br />The sound is ok-good.  Crisp and clear but I'm disappointed in the bass level.  For $40 I expected a bit more.  My $25 Senneheiser HD202's are just as crisp but have much more bass.<br /><br />Comes with a pouch to store them in which I won't use.  I think they give you the pouch because the gloss black finish can be easily scratched - not that I care how they look as long as they sound good.  The splitter is a nice bonus, always good to have an extra one of those. You can put it on a key ring which is nice for travel so you can clip it in your bag.  The packaging was nice.  Not a big deal, but sort of exciting because you felt like you were unboxing something very high end.<br /><br />3 stars because they are good, but not overly impressive by any means.

If you put the legs is a specific position and carefully set the unit down, sometimes it would stay up. Mostly it fell over forward. The only way I could get it to stay up was to hang my phone on it. I know it is advertised as working with a phone but I was really hoping it would work stand alone.<br /><br />I found it difficult to get the phone in just the right position to get an image with the phone's camera. A little high, a little to one side, then a little low etc. Eventually I could get it to work. It didn't seem to be worth the effort.<br /><br />I did take this out and tried to use it as a stand alone spotting scope. I took a different tripod. With a real tripod I had no trouble getting it set up. This is where I found how poorly this worked as a stand alone spotting scope. The image was only clear in the very center. Very poor image quality everywhere except in the very cent. Definitely not worth even trying to use it this way.<br /><br />I might try again next week using a phone. Maybe with the phone the image will be adequate. I have my doubts.<br /><br />One little positive, there is a small compass on the top. This seemed to work OK but it is too small to really be able to see which direction it is pointing.",negative,positive

"I am sorry but this is one of the rare times to find a product that I don’t recommend to anyone.  Given the nature of an iPad, the cons outweighs the pros.<br /><br />I purchased this one because I really like glass screen protectors and I was intrigued by the claims of a paper-like experience.  Indeed, this screen protector was great to write on.  It truly did alter the writing surface so that my writing was fast yet legible.  And, I liked the fact that is did not damage the nub of my pencil.<br /><br />The downsides, however, far outweighs these advantages.  The screen was hard to read in sunlight and in night mode.  I found myself turning it up to its highest setting (and thinking maybe something was wrong with my eyes) because the anti-glare features were really significant.  But, the worst of all is that it made my Ipad into a device that only registered my Pencil most of the time.  My iPad would not register me pressing and poking and swiping the screen.  I kept Ed trying repeatedly until finally I grabbed the pencil.  That worked but now that the iPad is set-up to write everywhere, it would leave stray marks.  And, I had to keep changing my iPad from typing mode to writing mode or vise versa constantly.  I was so frustrated that I was ready to erase my iPad and redo the set-up, thinking that this was the problem.<br /><br />I finally did what I hardly ever do -  I peeled off this nearly new screen protector and replaced it with a regular glass screen protector.  This replacement reminds me of just how difficult this one was.<br /><br />If an iPad can’t detect touch, it is practically useless.  And, with this screen on, the Apple Pencil was the only thing that did work most of the time.  And, while I love the pencil, it does not replace the gestures and other screen touches.  So, I am going back to the writing experience that I call ‘like writing on high quality paper with a good pen’ and leaving this ‘paperlike’ journey altogether.  And, based on my experiences, I can’t recommend this screen protector to anyone.",negative,positive

"I used this amplifier to boost the sound coming out of a Sennheiser headset while doing training through the internet. Since this is my occupation, and I have hearing loss and wear hearing aides, the use of the headset without the amp did not produce loud enough sound for comfortable conversation. This little amp boosted the sound perfectly, the size allowed me to carry it for use in different locations, and I was a happy camper. I just found, after four months, that I lost sound in one side of the headset, and by inserting and removing the amp and changing connections discovered that the problem is in the amp, not the headset or computer. Not sure if I should get another one of these or something else, loved the portability of it. Will have to look into the warranty, sure I no longer have the paperwork.<br />Update 5/2016: Amazon did begrudgingly refund the price of this amp (a Warehouse purchase, so they balked at warranty) and I purchased another, only to have it also die in a few months like the first. Will try to exercise the warranty on this one, but basically have a extra on hand or get another device...just not a lot this small. Looking for recommendations on something else.",neutral,positive

"I have been looking for a wireless extender and this one got good reviews and is small and supposedly simple to set up.  First of all, the quick instructions imply you can configure the device wirelessly.  I was unable to access it with a laptop or my iPhone.  I called tech support, which is very good, and they informed me that it is necessary to configure the machine with an ethernet connection.  Of course, my new ultrabook has no ethernet port, so I dusted off an old Win 7 laptop, which could not find the HWREN-25 either.  Another call to tech support and after half an hour of trying the web browser, turning off the wireless on the laptop and resetting the extender, the tech finally had me reconfigure the local connection with a fixed IP address, not the same one as the device usually requires but  an alternate one and suddenly we were in.  After that, a couple of clicks on the setup wizard and the device started working.  It works great, doesn't have a really big range, but I only needed an extra 20-25 feet to reach a family room and the signal is now strong in that room.  So I can recommend the Hawking if you don't need a powerful extender, but you may find yourself calling tech support to get it up and running.<br /><br />6/19:  Since original review, I have had to call Hawking several times as the extender would lose the wireless signal from the router after an hour or so. Unplugging it and replugging it in fixed the problem but only temporarily.  Changing the router to a fixed channel, 11, and disabling WPS on the extender is the latest fix and seems to be working in spite of the fact that the signal light no longer flashes.  Setting the router to channel 11 by itself did not work.  It remains to be seen if the HWREN25 will continue to lock on to my wireless signal.  Experimentation with different locations indicates that the device has a range of only 50 feet or less, 1/4 the advertised range, and 50 feet from my router with no obstruction, it has only 34% signal strength indicated during setup.  I have downgraded it to 2 stars, because of the limited range, and the difficulty getting it to work.  Tech support has been very helpful.<br /><br />6/20/2014:  Further experience has improved my impression of this product.  Recently, I found it wasn't working at all and with some difficulty, I was able to restore it to the factory default state using my old laptop and an ethernet cable.  The computer had trouble recognizing the Hawking but switching the device off a few times got it recognized and then it was easy to restore it using its web page.  After that, I decided to configure it using a software WPS switch available through my router's web page and suddenly it started working well.  It doesn't have a great range but my whole house is now covered by my router plus the Hawking.  I recommend that anyone considering this device configure it only by mating it with your wireless router using either a physical WPS switch or a software switch through the router's web page.  Don't try to do it with an ethernet cable through a computer.",neutral,positive

"I work as a freelance closed-captioner. I've gone through two sets of earbuds and wanted some good headphones, but the spiffy ones my hubby uses are so heavy and press down on my head. These are the complete opposite!! Lightweight, the blue band makes them comfortable, and the sound is awesome! Volume control is a very nice plus. I highly recommend these to anyone who is sensitive to pressure from the bulkier headphones but want a comparable sound quality - at a very affordable price! I also chose 1-day shipping so that I could use them for work today and it is totally worth it. Still under $20 with that, so how can you lose? Do not worry at all about these. They are phenomenal. Would definitely buy again, but hopefully won't need to for a while. :)<br /><br />** UPDATE: They break very easily. The part that plugs into the laptop just snapped off when I was repositioning my laptop. Very flimsy. I guess I'm back to buying cheap earbuds until I can afford better headphones. Bummer. If you buy these, just beware of this possibility!<br /><br />Additionally, the blue band stretched out or something, and the headphones became too big, even though they were adjusted to the smallest setting. I only had these for a little over two weeks and this happened, so buy at your own risk. I lowered my original 5 star rating to 3 because of these two issues. I'd still recommend these to anyone looking for a decent pair of inexpensive headphones, however. Just be aware and be very careful with them.",neutral,positive

While the top half is the 1 1/2&#34; light webbing, the lower half is a leather belt like strap.  So adjusting on the go is not happening.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- The section for the laptop is well padded as is the section for a tablet and has a velcro strap that goes over the top of those two sections and does hold your devices in place.<br />- The main compartment is roomy.  You can definitely fit some of the other things you need beyond just the devices.  Chargers, wallet, etc will all comfortably fit.<br />- The flap space isn't wasted!  It's a zippered pocket.  While it's not padded, the location of the pocket make it a handy spot for your phone.<br /><br />Additional / neutral:<br /><br />- The two lower front pockets.  They could be useful, but I consider them more decorative due to their size.  Too small for most modern phones.  You wouldn't be using them for much beyond maybe lip balm, things like that.<br />-The drawstring.  I love a good drawstring bag.  If a bag isn't zippered it better have a drawstring.  I just like to feel like my stuff is securely inside of my bag.  This one I have mixed feelings about.  A good sturdy drawstring goes completely around the bag.  This drawstring is only from the sides to the front.  I believe that's just to accommodate your laptop.  The padding in the back surely complicates doing a decent complete drawstring.  This means that the larger items like your computer or table are secured BUT, no matter how tight you cinch this up, you are left with a big enough space for a hand.  To me that isn't a huge deal but I do kind of see it as a slight security risk.  With the flap closed it's probably not a big deal to most people.  But it is still less than ideal.  I'll attach a photo of it pulled as tight as it goes to this to show what I mean.<br /><br />Overall:<br />If you are in a situation where style matters more than comfort or function then this is a pretty nice bag.  For me, I care more about comfort than style so it's just okay.  I won't be using it for its primary intended use of lugging around around electronics, so it's still very usable to me.  It is well made, so for the right person, this could be a dream bag.  It's just not my dream bag.",neutral,positive
"This was 50% off when I ordered it so I didn't have much to risk. I had low expectations at the under $10 price and I was not surprised. My first test was to place a piece of note paper on the top of a fan to see if it would be displaced from its position by the airflow. It was not. My second test was to see if it held against the unit on the inlet side of the fan. It was. So, my conclusion is it does move air, it just not concentrate the air it moves above the fan, and it generally leaks out all over the unit since it is mostly open space.<br /><br />These fan pads are intended for laptops with bottom air inlets. I'm not sure you could possibly see any difference in measured temperatures. I also don't think the lighting will impress you.<br /><br />The fan speed is rated at 1200RPM (1020-1380 RPM according to the box) and does not have a speed adjustment.<br /><br />The power cord is short (like most units), very thin, and not detachable.<br /><br />The company has locations in Hong Kong and Ireland but the product is made in China. In spite of the cute company materials included in the box, I could not recommend this for purchase as a cooler.",neutral,positive

"*UPDATED REVIEW*<br />Update:  Stars (3/5)<br />A few months have passed and the battery life has gotten waaaay better.  I don't know if it's an adjustment I made or if the machines just needed to power cycle a couple of times, but now I'm measuring these in months instead of a week or two.  That really was my principal complaint and I'm a lot closer to it being addressed.  I'll put it this way, now it's long enough between charges that I've had to start writing down when I charge them so I can keep track!  I've gotten it past a month now.  Who knows, maybe I will hit 3 months on one charge later this year.  It's certainly looking like it's possible now.<br /><br />I'd also like to mention that since I've gotten this device it has helped me solve a few mysteries about what's going on outside my window.  For example, I learned that squirrels daintily eat cat food one piece at a time!<br /><br />Original Review: 2/5<br />I'm really disappointed with this camera.  It's actually designed really well.  I love that they made the cameras battery-operated so you can easily mount them outside.  As an apartment dweller this is appealing to me.  The setup of it was pretty good.  The configuration of it isn't bad. It isn't uploading my videos to the cloud.  Heck, when the motion detection goes off it sends a thumbnail to my Apple Watch.  This is what I want!!!<br /><br />Except... no.  Remember the battery-operated bit?  They claim in the documentation that it should last approx 3 months.  I haven't gotten these cameras to last longer than a week.  I get that motion detection eats up battery, but the field of view of the camera is *very* wide and the motion detection sensitivity settings are nowhere near fine-grained enough to filter out things like people walking around across the street or the tress waving.  I don't see how I could even get in the neighborhood of their boast.<br /><br />Oh and one other thing about the battery.  When I first got it installed ONE of the cameras, its battery died, and my phone had a bunch of notifications alerting me that it needed to be charged.  (That's a 7 hour process, btw.)  Great!  Except the OTHER camera did not alert me.  I found that out when a kid was hit by a car in front of my apartment.  I went to go see if I had video that'd be useful and the camera had been dead for at least a day.  (The child is okay.)  Now maybe MAYBE I just missed the notification, right?  Welp, I charged the camera, set it up, waited a week.. same thing happened again, no notification of battery failure.  Not only is this a critical feature, but it also means that these cameras are only useful 6 days a week, the 7th day for charging.  No.<br /><br />One other serious issue I have with this system is that I motion detection does not work very well unless the camera is outdoors, I got soooo many false positives when I had the camera in the inside behind a window.  If you're a home-owner this probably isnt' a huge hurdle but as an apartment dweller it's a crappy limitation.<br /><br />What is keeping me from giving this just one star is it is a useful device.  For example, the next time I go on vacation and I'm going to be away from my apartment for a couple of weeks, I can tell you from personal experience this setup would be EXCELLENT for warning me if someone has entered my apartment.  Seriously, if I purchased it for that particular task I'd give it 4 stars.  But for outdoor monitoring, the battery life is a deal-breaker.<br /><br />I do want to stress one more time... this product really does hit all the right design-marks.  Seriously, I've used other cameras that don't think to do things like using a heavy-magnetic mount so you can easily take it down without it being loosey goosey and flapping around in the wind.  It's just really disappointing to see something as  well thought out as this was has such a crippling oversight.",neutral,positive

"I like this weather radio more as an FM radio than anything else.  This is the first Sangean radio I've ever owned and while I see others saying the sound isn't great compared to other Sangeans, I think it's spectacular compared to any other radio this size I've owned.  But on to the weather... Honestly if I had to do it all over, I'd probably buy one of the more user friendly Midland radios instead.  I bought this mainly b/c I thought it would look better beside my bed.  It does.  But to have so many options with only some buttons and a little directional pad to navigate...it's not extremely convenient.  Also, reception of the weather bands is not incredibly strong.  I've long wanted to buy the external antenna but the reviews of it have been amazingly and consistently bad so I've stayed away from it.  As it is, I have to keep the antenna pointed in exactly the right direction or I get nothing but static from a NOAA station that's probably no more than 5-6 miles away in a straight line from my home.  That's a little distressing, as the primary reason I bought this was for that odd, random tornado warning in the middle of the night.",neutral,negative

I bought this camera because I have a 1970 Minolta SRT 101 35mm camera with wide angle and telephoto lens. I understood that I could use my lens from Minolta with this Sony A350. I found out this would not work. I found that I like the camera and the lens I bought. I am still learning how to use it.,positive,positive
"I expected so much more out of this little radio/cd player.  I expected much better reception & sound quality.  The product comes with a template to help with installation but did not help us, we suggest eyeballing where your holes will go for the screws & not just relying on the template itself.  I am still debating on returning this item or not, mainly due to not being able to get a prominent radio station to come up.  The directions say the antenna is internal & if it doesn't have good reception, just move it-not really possible after installation.",neutral,positive

"I wanted to like this laptop.  But, alas, I can't -- the reason?  With all the bloatware, trying to set this to operate consistently has been impossible.  No matter what I set or how I set it (for example, the type size because I'm visually impaired) the very next time I boot it, it changes to something else.  Admittedly, some of that is the insanity of Window 10 but it is surely not limited to that.  Every day, I have to spend a half-hour or more tweaking settings back to where I want them.  It gets old.  Very old.  Very quickly.  Support for dealing with this problem is nonexistent, I get canned responses from Gigabyte that clearly indicate they aren't even trying to understand much answer the problem.  At this price point, that's just not good enough.<br /><br />My other laptop is an MSI -- while they deserve more credit than Gigabyte -- they are hardly stellar either which is why, after buying the MSI, I thought I'd try Gigabyte.  Big mistake, should have stuck with the devil I know......<br /><br />Understand that I'm not some gibbering technoignoramus -- with over 45 years of computing experience, I know my way around things PC -- yet this problem simply baffles me.  I've never, in my life, had any form of pc that resets itself to whatever settings it wants.  I can promise that I will never buy anything Gigabyte ever again.",negative,negative

"There are several things to like; first of all the price was great. Also, it is an attractive item, looks just like the picture except that actually the aqua part looks almost like it is lit from underneath so that it glows and that's not actually the case. However, it is very attractive. I especially like the silent clicking feature. I am not a fan of the way the wheel moves. It is not a smooth rolling movement that I like with some of my other devices, and it doesn't scroll as quickly as I'd like but I'm sure there is a way to speed it up in the settings I just haven't looked yet. Overall I like it a lot and would recommend it especially for a very functional silent mouse for a very good price.",neutral,positive

"Assembly of this stand is a breeze. I like how there is a duplicate adapter so that two different devices could be used or that a spare is available should the adapter break. I find that once attached to the base, my table is secure, but rocks back and forth a little bit.

That's fine if I am using this only for taking orders or getting customer signatures on a credit card. But I also use this for zoom meetings and need/want the potential to use horizontally. This was affordable enough to not bother returning it. But it is also disappointing every day.",neutral,positive

I bought this for my arctic circle trip and I am glad that I test it for a bit before I decided to keep this product and then I realized that the clamp had some paint scratches and the level that you lock the clamp was loose. I don't know if it is supposed to be like that or it was a defect but I did not want to take a chance of taking it with me all the way and find out later.<br />I have had two other 3LT tripods and both of those have the twist lock on the clamp as opposed to the level type on this. The twist lock on my other two (that aluminum and heavier so I did not want to take them on the long trip north) work perfectly and I even thought about take one off of those and putting them on this tripod but then I thought this is a $350 tripod and it should work like one.<br />Now that I made my complaints let me tell you about the tripod.<br />It is beautiful like other 3LT tripods and it sets itself apart from other tripods. The colored aluminum parts are gorgeous and nicely matched colors. The tripod itself is not very large and the legs are super skinny and you almost feel like it cannot stand the weight but according the specs it should handle up to about 40 lbs so no problems there. The biggest issue is that it has 4 twist locks on each leg so you are looking at unlocking and locking 12 of those to setup the tripod and we are not even talking about the two more on the center column. The sections of each leg are small but because it is so thin they made it into 4 sections to add stability. Another issue I had was that the twist locks are aligning so it looks really weird when you fold it. In the photos they are all aligned but in reality they are not.<br />The level lock on the clamp was loose and before locking but after locks in place it does not wobble anymore.<br />I know this is a travel tripod but to me it lacked the quality and the fact that the clamp was somehow damaged I decided to return it and go with Rhino from Benro. Perhaps I would have kept it if it was not defective or damaged but the box falling apart and the clamp defect made the decision for me. I think 3LT is one of the best tripod or camera accessory companies but I was kind of disappointed in this model and I think my Punk series Corey is even better than this.,neutral,positive

"The setup was easy; I plugged it into a [[ASIN:B000ZN0D04 Cambridge Soundworks Radio I765 Blk with A/V Entertainment]] and it worked quite well. I listen to podcasts from an Android phone (an HTC Evo) and it was drop-dead easy to send the audio to the stereo from the phone. It was a little harder to configure my wife's desktop computer to use a Bluetooth dongle to send audio to it, but still manageable. Only two caveats: placement of the receiver and the broadcasting bluetooth device may be critical, because it's possible to block the signal with your body. If you're listening to music and suddenly the playback gets skippy because you're blocking the receiver with your body . . . that will drive you nuts. I had to reposition my Bluetooth dongle and the receiver to avoid that sort of thing. Another thing I didn't expect was the delay in playback from the computer: you could click on iTunes, and then wait ten seconds before the sound finally made it to the stereo. (That may be a function of the broadcasting dongle and not the receiver's fault.) That delay is fine if you're just playing music from iTunes, but not for real-time audio applications like listening to Scorch files.",positive,negative
"I was wanting to love this camera, but the battery life was so poor I ordered 3 more spares and also the lens cover kept getting stuck on mine and I had to keep resetting it, by restarting.

Well no matter what kind of the battery I try to charge in it, after the battery achieves a 100% charge, the battery capacity indicator shows just a small fraction of the listed capacity on the battery.  So either the capacity indicator is wrong or the Miboxer is not charging the batteries correctly.

"[[VIDEOID:8bed6d79d90a43dd042702aefe52b20a]] I wanted to love this phone so badly. Now that LG has left the phone market, I wanted to know there are still flagship killers like Oneplus out there to take on the bullies of wireless phones. And on paper, there's a LOT to love about this phone. Let's mention the good things first:<br />- As a photographer, I really like the Hasselblad cameras that include a very capable manual mode. See the included photos taken with the phone, no fake bokeh effects. That's just the natural blurring DOF of the lens and sensor.<br />- As someone who is picky about user experience I absolutely LOVE the silent/vibrate/ring physical switch. All smartphones need that, in my opinion.<br />- CPU/GPU benchmarks are awesome, right up there with flagships that cost more.<br />- Coming from the Galaxy S10's terrible in-screen fingerprint reader, this one renews my faith in fp readers.<br />- Display is beautiful and crisp.<br />- Battery is surprisingly good.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the hardware is great! If they just throw a stock Android OS on here, it would be perfect! But sadly, no... they didn't. And the software is TERRIBLE. Chock full of bugs.<br />Some examples (some of which I tried to capture on video):<br />1) Google Voice call redirects are broken.<br />I've been using GV as my phone number for nearly a decade and never had a single problem like this before. The stock dialer does not care what you set GV to, it will IGNORE your outgoing call redirect requests. No matter what you set it to, it uses the carrier number to call out. Even if you select ""ask before each call"", the phone is so excited to dial out it will show you the option to pick, but in the background IT STARTED CALLING ALREADY and clearly doesn't care what you want. To be fair, this started with the Android 12 update on the Oneplus 9 series as well, so it's a Oneplus problem in general, it seems.<br /><br />2) Android Auto pop ups make no sense.<br />When you plug the phone into a USB port, it will prompt you with three options. Charge, Transfer Files / Android Auto, and Transfer Photos. When I plugged it into my car with AA, I see it starting on my car's display, but the pop up still appears on the phone. Naturally, I picked option 2, since it says android auto. It disconnects. So I unplug and try again, and leave it on charge, which seems to work. For the sake of testing, I also tried transfer photos, and it also worked. It seems that THE ONLY OPTION THAT DOESN'T WORK is the one that says Android Auto on it! Seriously?! Is it opposite day?! But that's ok, my car radio also supports wireless Android Auto (uses Wifi direct instead of a cable), so that should avoid the problem right?<br /><br />3) Wireless Android Auto breaks Wifi's ability to reconnect to known networks.<br />I know what you're thinking... come on, right? How many Google features can Oneplus break at a time. Apparently a lot. When using Android Auto over the wireless connection, it actually works great, but then the phone seems to give up ever wanting to connect to my known wifi networks again. I get to work or return home and found out that I've been using cellular data the entire time, unless I manually go into Wifi settings and click join network. If I leave the coverage area or toggle wifi off/on, it won't reconnect. I have to manually connect it in settings each time or be stuck using my data plan. A reboot fixes the problem and the wifi reconnects as expected afterwards... until the next time I take the car somewhere and the problem comes back.<br /><br />4) The 3.3x Telephoto camera has its own color science.<br />It doesn't match the others. The main camera is actually quite good, and the wide is decent as well. The telephoto is a bit less vibrant and noticeably more dull on warm color themes. I though these were Hasselblad tuned and calibrated to have professional color science and detail? This isn't a major issue, it just seems surprising. Especially when you point the camera at something that is too dark for the limited exposure capability of the 3.3x tele lens, and it jumps to a zoomed in version of the main camera lens instead. Seriously- see my video for a demonstration of that. You see the color suddenly shift into something that looks very different whenever it changes. The main zoomed in actually looks better, and it has enough native pixels to resolve a decent image... which then begs the question of why even have a dedicated 3.3x tele lens?<br /><br />4) The notifications in the shade don't let you jump to the application... only individual messages. For example, if I have a bunch of Gmail messages, I can see them in the shade and click them individually to go to them each. But I can't just go to Gmail and see my inbox. Sometimes I want to see my inbox and decide what to respond to first. I have to either go to an individual message, or back out and find the Gmail icon to click it directly.<br /><br />All in all, the phone is usable but I just can't shake the feeling that the OS is half baked and not ready for release yet. The Android Auto issues and Google Voice ones are so major to the way I use my phone on a daily basis, I might prefer to go back to a device from 3 years ago than continue using this one. It just feels unpredictable and unreliable in its current state. I really do hope Oneplus fixes those bugs soon, because the hardware really is nice. Or better yet, give us the option to run a stock Android without all this OOS nonsense. The customizations aren't a selling point, they are detrimental at best and downright BREAK CERTAIN FUNCTIONALITY at worst. I will gladly change my review and update the rating if an update that addresses these issues comes around. Come on, Oneplus. We know you can do better than this on a phone that costs this much.",negative,positive

"I love this keyboard. but as many others have said, the clips to hold the iPad inplace break and there is nothing to be done about it.

The FM stations drift and do not stay when you turn the radio on again.  The clock is terrible to adjust and did not adjust for time change.

"Works perfect with Wink hub with 2 exceptions. 1. If there is no motion to be armed for 48+ hours, the device will send a disconnected alert. As soon as motion is armed this is corrected.

"I've steered clear of WD products for several years due to bad customer service / warranty problems in the past, but I've heard that their support had improved over the years so I thought I'd give them another try.<br /><br />But I was recently in need of a small, high-capacity external drive for a project with a Raspberry Pi, so I pulled the trigger on this.<br /><br />To borrow a phrase, ""Purchase in haste repent at leisure"". I really wish I had not wasted my money on this junk.<br />The capacity is fine. It comes pre-formatted with NTFS, and that's fine. It's quiet, and that's fine.<br /><br />The problem is that this device consumes a LOT of USB power. So much, in fact that a Raspberry Pi 4, with an external 3-amp power supply, won't boot with this power hog attached. And, due to the high power consumption, it runs quite warm, too.<br /><br />I have a similar Seagate 5GB external drive installed on another system and it is working just fine in an otherwise identical application.<br /><br />I wish I'd done just a little more homework, and remembered all the times I've regretted purchasing WD consumer-grade junk.<br /><br />Now I'm in the position of just having to bite the bullet and purchase a different drive with lower power requirements or insert a self-powered USB hub (adding yet another item to fail!) to the composition.<br /><br />Fool me once, shame on you.

I bought a used Sony Nex 3N for a back up camera.  However the sensor was pretty dirty.  I took several shots of the clear blue sky and the dust was readily apparent.  I initially tried a blower to remove the dust but to no avail.  After investigating several different types of sensor cleaning kits (and pricing out the cost of having a &#34;professional&#34; do it) I got this kit.  It took six complete passes with the swab/Eclipse combo to remove whatever was on the sensor.  Six complete passes = three swabs.  When I got done the sensor was perfect.  I was actually kind of surprised because whatever was on the sensor was more than just dust.  The Type 2 fit the sensor perfectly on the NEX.  I would definitely recommend this kit.  Comes in a little zipper kit so you could take it in the field if you wanted to.,positive,positive
Spoke to five individuals and they keep reminding me that they cannot help me due to watch bought over 30 days. I know this. That is why I purchased a 2-year protection plan.

"I was surprised at how well the suction worked on this device. Some states like California and Washington, D.C. made it illegal to place any mounts on windshield.  I was able to place the sticky suction on my uneven dashboard, flip the housing switch and the mount became absolutely solid.  The cradle (which is detachable) held my iPhone (it works with many similar phones) but the suction on the back felt like it wouldn't last.  In fact, I wished the cradle had some kind of stiff holder for more security.  Then it would be held by two sources.<br /><br />FRIEQ states that the stickiness will return after washing off dust or dirt, but I don't quite feel that it held my phone securely enough.  There is also a more permanent mount included that you attached to your dashboard that acts as a base for this car mount.  The cradle does rotate 360 degrees and angles so you can view your phone properly.  For the low price, it's not a bad deal, but your phone is precious.

However I can have multiple devices work with it so long as they don't run iOS.<br /><br />For example, I can use it with my iPad and my Nexus 7 Android tablet, but I cannot use it with two iPads or an iPad and an iPod Touch.<br /><br />It was a little disappointing since I sometimes need two iOS devices hooked to it at the same time.

"Don't buy.  I paid just over $300 for my first 750n and just under $300 for three more 700n(s).  For the currently listed price of over $600, you can get a MUCH better camera AND SUPPORT!  If your camera fails within the first year, you'll contact Logitech and explain to them what happened, and you'll get a replacement camera when and if they have a replacement in stock.<br /><br />If you purchased a camera over a year ago, they won't help you at all....you're out $$$.<br /><br />I used a POA setup and not ethernet.  If you lose power, change routers or anything that will cause the camera to go offline temporarily, the camera may never come back online.  In just under two years, several of my cameras failed.  All but one was still under warranty--so with the exception of that one camera, I received replacements.  Now, as each camera fails (and they will fail), I'll be out of luck.  It's a sad, sad proposition Logitech has set up for its customers.  As other posters have said, I will never buy another Logitech item as long as I live.<br /><br />Buy a different brand.  Read up on solid cameras (with support) at the &#34;Cam It!&#34; forum.  Also, you don't need to pay an outrageous price for the Logitech software (Commander) that comes with their cameras.  It's over-priced (bundled with the 750n) and doesn't provide the capabilities you'd expect unless you pay extra for a service to do things like get video alarms sent directly to your smartphone.  Go find the cameras you want, then buy &#34;Blue Iris&#34; camera software.  At $50, it's the best software you'll find and supports 99% of the cameras on the market and will able you to monitor a crazy number of cameras if your computer or DVR equipment can handle it.<br /><br />I won't have time to respond to any of your questions, but take my word for it, you will regret this purchase unless your support channel guarantees you lifetime replacement of these cameras because they will fail.",negative,negative
"These earphones provide average sound, nothing spectacular.  But they are good enough for my IPODS and Kindle Fire.<br /><br />The problem arises when you need to put these hooks around the ear.

"The only purpose of this was to be a Wireless Bridge between a desktop and PS3 console that was located in a room with no available wired connections.

"It does the job, and I have a fairly powerful and functional computer, but on consideration I think I should have considered some of the alternatives instead.<br /><br />The most frustrating problem has been unaccounted for behavior with Windows 7, apparently related to the mobo.  For instance, wake from sleep consistently crashes the computer (I checked the dumps to verify that it was definitely a wake-related crash), and there is (as yet) no bios or driver update to fix it.  Ok, sleep isn't that important, I can live without it.  But sometimes a simple reboot will hang, apparently in the same place, right when Windows should be booting up.  A forced shutdown (holding the power button for several seconds) and restart fixes that problem.  But neither of these is really expected, or acceptable.<br /><br />A lesser problem is the sound -- somehow it's tinny, sounds worse than the audio on my 5-year old mid-range computer.  I'm probably going to buy an audio card, which shouldn't have been necessary.<br /><br />The onboard networking is just fine, I haven't had any problems with it.  The onboard video is ok as well, but I didn't test that too much since I added a separate video card.<br /><br />I think I should have gone with MSI or Asus instead, and that's what I'm going to look at when my son & I build a mid-price gaming rig for him later this fall.",neutral,negative

"[[ASIN:B005LS0ADS Toshiba Camileo X200 HD 1080p Camcorder, 12x Optical Zoom, 3"" Touch Screen]]I bought the X200 because it offered to features I wanted, a remote control and an external mic input. One down side two the operation of the camera is the zoom. It zooms in preset increments. It's user manual is on a disc and has to be installed to be read. However there is no explaination as to why you should use a setting or not use it in the discription. Lastly the flaw! And it seems to be a design flaw. The mic input produces a ""Whirring"" sound behind the audio which is very loud when there is no audio or spoken words. At first I thought it was a mismatch with my mic so I tried several. Some powered some not. Then I found on line at one of Toshiba's sites five reports from buyers, had the same problem which tells me that the company knows of the problem and has not done anything about it by removing the existing stock off the market. I contacted their 'Tech Support' and they are no help at all. I don't think they even know what a comcorder is! They finaly sent me a replacement camera after I paid to return the one I had.

"Loved the idea of a spotlight combined with a motion camera.  I set this up to watch my cars in my driveway.  I've had 2 car break ins in the last year.  My hope was to scare the crook away with the light popping on, before they broke into my car.  Unfortunately, it was a failure.  No matter the zone and sensitivity settings, it was very poor at detecting people.  I'd approach the cam straight on from the edge of my driveway, which was about 25.5' away for testing.  I would be 6-10' away, in front of the cam, with my arms raised above my head, waiving them about, and it would not detect me even 50% of the time.  It was great at catching cars driving by.  After messing with the settings for over 2 weeks, and seeing no improvement, I called their help line.  I was on the phone for 45 minutes with them.  They were attentive and did try to help my adjust the settings, or aim the camera up or down, but nothing improved it.  I was told that the height I had it at was fine, so that was not the issue.  I was told that a specialist would call me the next night at a time I designated.  No one called the next night.  At that point I returned it.  Ring was easy to work with, and accepted the return (it was just a day under the 30 day return window).  The battery life was OK.  Not great.  The battery lasted about 2-3 weeks before needing a recharge.  The shorter battery life than expected could have been due to me changing the settings repeatedly every other day or so.  The wifi was OK.  It claimed it was a weak signal, but rarely disconnected.  I tested the same location with my phone and average about 25 Mb/s.

There is no optical viewfinder, rather it has an window that you look through that gives you a low quality image of what you would otherwise see were you to look at the screen.  The menu options have been reduced by half.  There is no way to choose your ISO settings and much of the control is taken away from the user. Booooo Nokia.  The standards I once appreciated in this brand are clearly in the toilet.  I'll be looking into Cannons.",negative,negative

"Not sure if I should have given this four stars or five.  I docked a star because it's not comfortable for typing a lot, like if you're writing or typing up a document.  It's not bad, and it's a lot better than another brand I tried, but for speed, I take it off.<br /><br />The rest of the time, when I'm just surfing, I keep it on.  It protects the keyboard from crumbs and spatters.  It fits the keyboard extremely well.  I haven't used many of these keyboard covers, but I suspect this may be the best one out there for the Macbook.<br /><br />I have noticed it getting cloudy as others have said, but not too bad so far.  I can still see the keys well enough, and really, I don't look down anyway.  I haven't tried to see if it's easy to clean or not, yet.  Also, it doesn't usually stick to the computer screen when you lift the lid.  Maybe once or twice.  I know some people have complained about that, with other brands.  Overall, worth the money.  If I lost it, I'd buy it again.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I lost it.  I'm buying it again.  LOL.  For a while I tried using one I got for free with a neoprene case I bought. It was much thicker, cheaper, and looser, and it stretches out when you mess with it.  So I'm buying this keyboard skin again, which was far superior.  But I'll still take it off when doing a lot of non-stop writing.  As keyboard skins go, it fits really well and stays in place.",positive,positive
"Great idea but extremely buggy; screen doesn't follow consistently and the mic is buggy.  I've had an issue of some kind with almost every call.  Screen stops following during calls and more than a few times when I say ""Alexa follow me"" it disconnected the call; happened again yesterday.  It also randomly faces the opposite direction  of where I am during a call.  The mic seems to not follow the screen, while standing directly in front of the unit 4 feet way the mic sometimes makes me sound like I'm in the other room.  I've tried the unit in my great room and in  a corner in the kitchen with limited motion and the issues happen both places.<br />The speaker is great, Alexa integration is great picture quality is good and the concept is cool but don't think the software is near ready.  I was hoping some kind of update would be pushed out, I don't think it has because nothing has changed.

"Picture is really nice with exception to the dreaded DSE which has really become difficult to ignore (if you don’t know what it is do yourself a favor and do not investigate). The real disappointment for me here involves audio passthrough. For those of you looking to integrate with an AVR without HDMI 2.1, the TV will not passthrough multichannel LPCM signals or DTS. My Pioneer Elite receiver is HDMI 1.3b which restricts even more but can’t buy a new AVR. Nearly All of 4K UHD media (except streamed) is in DTS. The TV will down convert any DTS or multichannel PCM to 2 channel PCM. It does passthrough Dolby atmos and Dolby digital and Dolby TrueHD via eARC but my AVR doesn’t support Atmos and only a few of my Blu-ray’s are TrueHD - none of the 4K ones, however. Samsung does not communicate or share the details of firmware updates or if they will or will not work on anything you submit as an issue so if you find an issue and hope they address them you will never know if they are or are not working on it. If only they’d address the multichannel PCM passthrough like Sony and LG did. I have to return this since window to return is almost up.",neutral,negative

It does this about once every 30 seconds to a minute; it doesn't matter where you are relative to the transmitter.  Second, the battery life quotes are dreaming.

"I purchased this camera to monitor my front yard through the window because I wanted to avoid difficulties of installation and wiring of an outdoor camera. However, I found that this camera has too many problems. I am thinking about returning it and buying something better. Please read pros and cons below.<br /><br />Pros:  1. Decent video quality. But these days all HD cameras have good video quality.<br />  2. Relatively easy setup procedure.<br /><br />Cons:  1. No manual at all. Just few lines of setup procedure. You will have to search online to find out camera<br />  features and how to use them.<br /><br />  2. It records only 12 seconds of video to the CLOUD. It is a joke. So, you can only review the beginning of<br />  event. If a thief stole the package from your front door you wouldn’t be able to prove it because the camera<br />  wouldn’t record the moment of stealing. Thief can say that he was just passing by.<br /><br />  3. Recording to SD card is not very reliable. When I review recorded events they sometimes disappear or skip<br />  fragments. For example, I see a school bus that is coming to the picture, but then it suddenly completely<br />  disappears in the middle of moving.<br /><br />  4. Motion activation is not reliable, but rather random. I came home yesterday, right in front of camera, but<br />  nothing was detected and recorded. Like I was a ghost. Camera also did not detect and did not record<br />  anything at all when my son left this morning. Right in front of camera he got into his car and drove away.<br />  Nothing was recorded at all.<br /><br />  5. Bad customer support. During the camera setup I had to create a WYZE account and give my email address. I<br />  received a verification code my email address and used it for camera activation. However, whey I tried to<br />  access my account on the WYZE web site, my email address was not recognized. How can it be? I submitted a<br />  support request and get automated email response that somebody from WYZE will contact me soon. After<br />  that nothing happened. I waited for few days, but nobody from WYZE contacted me to resolve my problem.<br /><br />  6. The camera is practically useless for night monitoring. It captures invisible to normal eye window light<br />  reflection. That reflection obscures outside view.",negative,negative

It looks like it may be a remainder piece of sheet metal with cheap plastic marginally functional as a way to potentially angle your laptop so it does not slide off.

Just buy the more expensive one that you won't have to uninstall the next day.<br /><br />I personally bought the blitzsafe version. Happy with it so far, it's working just fine, and seems to be more solid than this one in the build.<br />Further, it allows you to choose the cable yourself so you can pick whatever style of rca to 3.5mm you might like.<br /><br />Save the frustration of this stupid product and buy the better version!<br /><br />On the plus side, return through Amazon was as easy as it could have been once I removed the dang thing.",negative,positive

If I wear a hoodie or collared shirt, the band hits the hood or collar and moves the headphones around on my head. Drives me crazy. Also, the fit around the ear is kinda weird and gives me a little bit of a headache. I'm always surprised at just how uncomfortable I was when I take them off. All this said, I still always use them to run because I like that they don't move (unless I have a collar or something to catch it on) and I can hear everything around me so I know to move over when a bicycle comes up behind me.

"I bought two of these radios not too long ago. As many of you know, this is one Baofeng's newest radios which claims to be a 5 watt Max power radio and waterproof. Both of those claims are FALSE! This radio is neither 5 watts and worst IT IS NOT WATERPROOF. I tested the power output with an SWR meter and these radios barely put out 3 watts if you're lucky and get a good one from the batch. I bought these radios because I really liked the look of the radios design and I thought I would get at least 5 watts all the way up to maybe 8 watts but that didn't happen. Also, I tested one of the radios in the backyard swimming pool in the most shallow part of the pool which is about 3 feet for about 10 minutes and water came into the battery compartment and the radio itself. I could see the water inside the screen of the radios which eventually shorted out the radio and destroyed it. I have one more of these radios left from the pair I bought but I gave it to my 8 year old nephew to use as a toy walkie talkie cause that's what this radio is and is worth....the price of a cheap kids walkie talkie and nothing more than that. Stay away from this radio. Looks can be deceiving but if I could go back a few days ago and knew how bad this radio was, I would have never bought it. Why didn't I return the radios to Amazon for a refund? Because these cheap Made in China radios aren't even worth the time and effort to get a refund as far as I'm concerned. One is in the garbage can and the other is used as a toy by my nephew. I DO NOT recommend these Baofeng UV-9R Pro to nobody. Save your money for a while longer and just get yourself a proven and trusted quality Japanese radio instead. These Made in China radios are flooding the US market and are mostly all overrated as far as power, functionality and build quality. Sure, the Chinese can build a radio with Japanese standards but they will have to raise the price and they know they will loose a huge part of their market who happens to like these affordable, cheaply made radios.

"I got this for my daughter. I had very bad luck with Sony reliability a decade or so back; one Trinitron TV I bought died after 91 days - one day after the warranty ran out. Our Sony camcorder went in for repair every few months for years, until the extended warranty ran out. Even though we didn't pay to fix it, we missed a lot of memories while it was being repaired. After that, I swore no more Sony products.<br /><br />But my daughter really wanted this, and the reviews seemed OK, so I gave it a chance. It seemed OK until she lost the computer cable needed to download photographs. That's when I remembered the other reason I avoid Sony: The memory card is a weirdo format only made by Sony - it doesn't fit any of the standard card readers we have, either at home or at work. Same with the cable - Sony could have used an ordinary USB, but instead they put a non-standard Sony-only connector on the camera. Bottom line is that to get my daughters pictures I have to pay Sony a ridiculous price for a specialty item that is useless except for this camera. This time I swear: No more Sony for me.<br /><br />Too bad, because the camera is OK otherwise. It takes good pictures, is easy to use, and still works fine after 6 months.<br /><br />Update: I actually found a card reader at my local drugstore for $20 which read the Sony's goof-ball memory card. My daughter got her pictures, and I only wasted $20 and several hours of my time. I still wish Sony should use standard connectors and parts rather than trying to lock us in to their own non-standard designs, but except for that my daughter likes the camera; so I upped my rating to 3 stars. However for my next camera I'm going back to Canon - they make solid, standards-based cameras, even if they don't make a pink one; and every canon I ever bought still works - some (like my 35mm SLR film camera) over 20 years later. But if you never lose cables, don't want to swap or read memory cards, and really like Pink, then this Sony might be OK for you.",neutral,positive

"I ordered a set of these based on the many positive reviews, and was excited to finally use them. I used it for barely thirty minutes and they stopped working. I tried to charge them following the instructions, and still they wouldn’t hold a charge. I requested a replacement as it appeared my first set was defective and received the replacement within 24 hours surprisingly. I go through the process yet again to pair them with my iPhone (which is the easy part) and the replacement pair worked for barely 30 minutes and died — again. I put them in the charging case (per the instructions, a red solid light indicates as charging). The buds charged for 10 minutes and disconnected, wouldn’t charge at all. At this point, going back to read the charging instructions I find there’s misspelling within the instructions, and overall understanding them is beyond complicated based on how these are manufactured. These personally failed me twice and will be returned. I only provided a star rating for the one area that I was able to experience which was sound quality.<br /><br />I’m disappointed with these buds and they need improvement — differentiating the understanding between the light indicators following the manual does not work.",negative,negative

Then push excess cable into the access hole in wall and attach mount to the wall.<br /><br />Also if you need to mount to stuco, cinderblock or other cement/concrete type of material then the diamond grit hole saws work best for the access hole, i use the uxcel 32mm model.

"The camera is small, light, highly portable and easy to use.  It takes nice pictures under good lighting situations, and particularly outdoor situations. However, I've found a few issues with it:<br /><br />1.  ISO noise seems excessive.  The noise at ISO levels 400+ is really among the worst I have seen, even for a point and shoot.  As a result, it's really not my first (or second) choice for low lighting (often indoor) shots without using a flash.  It works well enough with a flash, but so do most cameras.  Trying to take non-flash pictures indoors with this camera is a chore because of the high level of noise at even moderate ISO settings.<br /><br />2.  Odd juxtapositions in the design.  For example, the camera cannot both date stamp and use its electronic vibration reduction function at once -- that's a very odd trade-off, and smacks of some very odd engineering decision.<br /><br />3.  Limited on-screen information.  While shooting it will at least provide your aperture and shutter speed, but it doesn't on playback, and there is no option for controlling that display information.  Other cameras (like Panasonic's DMC-FS3) display aperture, shutter speed, ISO and WB all on the playback screen.  I like to review these things when looking at an exposure to determine whether I want to adjust anything for the next one, and not being able to see this information on the review display is quite annoying on a camera that has been recently released.<br /><br />In all, this is a fine camera for quick outdoor shooting.  For virtually anything else I plan to do with a point and shoot, my first choice is Panasonic's Lumix DMC-FS3.  I'm not happy to say that, because I am generally a fan of Nikon equipment, and my digital SLR equipment is all Nikon ... but the Panasonic beats this camera pretty much across the board, I'm afraid, while also being slightly cheaper.",neutral,negative

"The field of personal entertainment is still in its infancy. Many companies, large and small, are still trying to figure out the correct formula. Avegant's debut product battles with its main function hinging on a mostly unproven technology. Instead of having dedicated displays in front of each eye to form the final image, the Avengant Glyph utilizes micro DLP projection to push light directly into the user's eyes. The main advantage of doing this is its ability to overcome the screen door effect where individual pixels have a discernible separation between them. What the glyph has is a very clear, crisp picture with seamless pixels. This is the facet that shines in terms of its display.<br /><br />The technology suffers from a number of encumbering flaws. Instinctively, one would presume that a direct projection of an image into the user's retina equates to a very immersive picture experience. Avegant promises a viewing experience that's perceptively similar to being inside of a theatre. Unfortunately, the resulting picture feels more like you're viewing the rectangle of your telephone screen while holding it at arms length in front of you with the lights turned off. The picture feels small. Its diopters can only do so much to tell your brain you're looking at something bigger, and it doesn't do the trick. Your periphery is left with the hollow black insides of the device that struggle to maintain complete darkness as the plastic internals reflect parts of the picture into your eyes. The diopter lenses suffer from chromatic aberration if your eyes are even slightly offset (high contrast edges have a red and blue tinge to them). It also has issues with tangential aberration (the edges of the viewport are blurry). Because the picture is being delivered directly to the user's retina, any eye movement breaks the picture. Eyes must be focused forward at all times, which feels unnatural as eyes instinctively want to move around the picture when action is happening on screen. If anything is framed out side of center, you'll accidentally break focus and subsequently break the image projection. I suppose it's safe to watch Wes Anderson films with this since everything is framed symmetrically centered.<br /><br />Comfort is another place where this device struggles. However, it must be stated that the problem with comfort isn't unique to the Avegant Glyph. All personal theatre devices still have to figure out how to distribute the weight of the device so that its doesn't feel clostrophobic or encumbering. Being tethered to an HDMI cable and the somewhat necessary micro USB cable for power doesn't help its cause. Even after a few minutes of wear, the bridge of my nose started to ache from the weight of the device. I tried all the different nose pieces it comes with in combination with an additional headband to no avail. Out of the box, the caliper pressure of the headphones is very tight. It squeezes your temple as it grapples with trying to hold the offset weight of the display in front of your eyes. After watching a 30 minute show wearing the device, I started to feel stuffy and realized how warm my ears have gotten inside the headphones. Thankfully, it does have a saving grace.<br /><br />The sound from the headphones is made for entertainment. It has a very nice low end that's a little loose in a fun way. Everything rumbles. Explosions sound huge. The mids are pretty neutral and the highs are present without being over emphasized. I listed to music with these as well, and it sounded great. The soundstage is wide and very immersive. Device controls were intuitive enough. Paring them wirelessly was a quick and painless process.<br /><br />This is a very commendable first attempt. There is still plenty of room for improvement, and I hope they continue to push the field of personal entertainment forward. All things considered, it's really hard to recommend this product to a regular end user. It's a cool piece of tech, but the price point is a huge barrier to entry into a theatre experience that leaves too many things to be desired.",neutral,positive

Both systems are used for hours daily except when traveling on vacations. They've never had a mechanical problem. They can be fussy playing DVDs but it's never been anything to get a mental wedgie over. Most of the time some dish soap or Windex on the DVD solved the issue. Bose support has been phenomenal when I had questions. Sound is fantastic. I purchased these to get away from what seemed like miles of wires and cables and dozens of places to plug them into. The 200 hours of HDD space for recording music is wonderful as is the unit's ability to play your favorites more often. I don't use the AM/FM on the unit but do cable all audio directly to the unit from other devices. (Video goes directly to monitor/TV.) Both of my units were purchased before they upscaled DVDs so I just connect to a newer player.

"In the current form as Ty/reviewer mentions, the Coodio Full Helmet headset's cords are too short and is unusable out of the box, EXCEPT, if you plan on clipping your radio on your body.<br /><br />Following are the difficulties and tips to modify it to work for a handlebar mounted radio.<br /><br />First of all, the whole thing could be solved if the coiled cable which connects the PTT button was spliced in with Mini DIN connectors on both ends AND 4 conductors connected.  THEN, for a radio that's mounted on the left handlebar with the PTT button mounted on the left grip, you'd only need about 10 inches of cable AND one could use the coiled cable as a MIC extension cable and extend the reach to the helmet from 2' to about 5'.<br /><br />Silly me, I think, I'm not without basic soldering skills, I can do that myself. Problem#1: The screw lock Mini DIN connectors appear to be proprietary and after searching high and low and contacting coodioradioDOTcom which turned out to be a blackhole, opted to replace the DIN connectors with 3.5mm TRRS connectors. Problem#2: After you cut the cable you find out that the cable is a 5 conductor audio cable with strands the size of a hair, wound around threads of Kevlar (?) for strain relief.  They are near impossible to tin. It's a study in frustration to solder up a female TRRS jack.  Forget about soldering up a male TRRS plug.  Just in case you want to be stupid too, the color code is Red:SPK+, Copper:SPK-, Green:MIC+, Blue:MIC-. PTT uses Blue&Copper.<br /><br />BTW, remember the coiled cable part that I intended on removing and reusing as an extension for the speaker/microphone?  Well, because it's just connecting the PTT button, Coodio decided only to connect two of the 5 conductors in the cable to the Mini DIN connector, so the DIN connector can't be reused.<br /><br />Also, even if you have a 0.9mm hex driver to back out the internal hex head screw to release the screw-lock housing, the Mini DIN connector pins are flowed with plastic for strain relief and as an electrical insulator and you can't remove the plastic without damaging the pins.<br /><br />In the end, I was able to solder the &#34;hairs&#34; to remove the coiled cable and shorten the PTT cable, as well as replace the Speaker/Microphone cable Mini DIN connectors with female TRRS jacks. Repurposing the coiled cable was abandoned.<br />… I purchased a 3-foot 4-pole TRRS coiled cable.<br /><br />IF I had to do it all over again, here's what I would have done… and will TRY to do if this setup goes tits up.<br /> - BTECH 2 Pin to 3.5MM Adapter with Push-to-Talk Button (Adapts 2 Pin BaoFeng/Kenwood/BTECH Radios to 3.5mm Headsets with in-line Mics)<br /> - 3.5mm Male 4 Pole Angled to 1/8&#34; Female 4 Pole Audio Coiled Spiral Adapter Cable<br /> - 3.5mm Male TRRS to 2 Female TRS Audio Connector TRRS Y Splitter Cable Adapter<br /> - 7.5ft Length 3.5mm Jack Motorbike Helmet Speakers for MP3 Motorcycle Bike (hack off the volume control and shorten)<br /> - 3.5mm Car External Microphone Mic DVD Radio Stereo Player HeadUnit Cable 3m<br /><br />I DON'T recommend his product if you want to mount your radio anywhere except clipped/holstered to your body….

"This may be an eminently useful connector when used with the Surface RT - I simply don't know - however, I can attest that it does not work with the Surface Pro.  For reasons which elude logic, the two tablets require signficantly different connectors: the Surface RT's looks like a mini USB and has an angled connection base; the Surface Pro's is apparently a much larger, proprietary design.  Don't be misled by the photographs of the two products on Microsoft's own website which make it appear that the two are identical.  They're most definitely not, which Microsoft customer support acknowledges with an apology for being so vague on this point.  The front of Microsoft's packaging of both units states simply ""SURFACE - VGA Adaptor.""  Only on the back cover will you find in 6pt type that it's for an RT (or presumably for a Pro).  The major retailers selling the Surface Pro (Staples, Best Buy) both seem confused--though as nearly as I can tell their websites only stock the RT version adaptors.  Pro owners proceed with great caution - it may well be for the moment that the Microsoft Store is the only sure source of the right adaptor.

"I am not a techno-snob, but there are a few things about this TV that drop the rating to 3 stars.<br /><br />I noticed others complain about the wi-fi not connecting, I have not had this problem. It connects fine. It takes 30 seconds for HD to kick in once in a while on Amazon Prime stuff, but I can live with that.<br /><br />What I don't like is the color adjustment. When I watch se streaming movies, the actors have yellow lips. I have tried playing with different presets, and the RGB, and it srill looks like everyone has jaundice.<br /><br />When I watch cable (which is a low def box in my bedroom), the brightness will increase and decrease randomly. With no change of shot. Same scene on a show or movie, it will just dim slightly. Irritating.<br /><br />It's a decent set, and I do not know if others have these issues, but mine does.

"The Altec Lansing UHP326 headphones sound great overall.  The UHP326 headphones deliver clear sound which an emphasis on treble.  I prefer headphones that emphasize treble, so these worked well for me.<br /><br />The headphones come with several sets of ear plugs in various sizes plus a choice of cylindrical or oval shape.  My preference was for the cone shaped plugs and it's nice that they were included.  Many other headphones just come with different size plugs, but not different shapes.<br /><br />Since the cord is covered in cloth, it tends not to tangle, but also tends to transfer noise to the ear buds when it rubs against clothes.  The cord is adjustable with a little tab that goes up and down.  I found that moving the tab up towards my chin greatly reduced the noise that was transferred from the cord hitting into my clothing.  The transference of noise from the cord rubbing against clothes to the ear buds is very noticeable and the reason I am giving the headphones 4 out of 5 stars as opposed to 5 out of 5.<br /><br />For audio geeks, the frequency response is 20hz - 20kHz (-10dB) with an impedance of 16 Ohms and an input sensitivity of 104dB SPL/mW @ 1kHz (taken from the package).<br /><br />Overall, these headphones produce a nice sound, especially for their class",positive,positive

"I think I spent more time researching covers than I did the actual Kindle... since it seemed a bit extravagant to spend 60% of the purchase price of the Kindle on a cover, I decided to try this one at substantially less. It arrived timely and seemed fine... the Kindle ""wiggles"" into a built in pocket that is sized correctly and doesn't seen to interfere with the operation of the Kindle. I especially liked the built in pocket on the left-hand side and the fact that it closed easily with the magnetic tab.<br /><br />For about a week.<br /><br />Then the disk inside the padded cover came loose and slid to the bottom of the cover rendering the tab useless. I contacted customer service and was pleased with the response--I could return for a refund. Of course this meant packaging it, shipping it back, etc. I found myself thinking I'd been saving dollars but wasting time (time is money, right?) so I replaced it with a Kindle lighted cover. I simply wasn't convinced I wouldn't have the same problem again if I ordered another.

"The [[ASIN:B00728ZBC0 Panasonic Lumix ZS20 14.1 MP High Sensitivity MOS Digital Camera with 20x  Optical Zoom (Silver)]] is an incredible little camera. It has a ton of features including full manual control and 1080p/60p video in AVCHD Progressive mode and 1080p/30p in mp4.  The pictures are very good and there isn't much need to change from the Intelligent Auto (I.A) mode for most shooting conditions. You also get the ability to store custom settings if you need to. The detail in photos and video is very good, shooting performance is very good with a very fast autofocus system. Macros are beautiful and have rich vibrant colors. The 20x zoom is very good but can be difficult to keep steady whilst shooting video (use a tripod for best results). For still shots, there's some color loss (as expected) at maximum zoom but the photos are still pretty good. The flash is very bright though, so you may not want to use it for very close shots.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very good camera in a small package. I still find it hard to come to terms with the number of features in such a small package.",positive,positive

"Pro:<br />Packaging was impressive and fair, as far as the extra materials given for the earphones and case to store the earphones.<br />length of wires were appropriate.  Easy to figure out how to turn it on and Bluetooth to a device.  I didn't read the manual and I was able to connect to my Bluetooth.  Once on, sound quality was fair to good for the everyday person.  I'm sure if your a pro, you can pick up the little differences when compared to others.  At this time, battery life appears to be very good and recharging with a speed charger is great.  The ear bud component that goes into the ear feels very comfortable, and it doesn't feel like its going to slip out when walking around or sitting.  Haven't tested in the gym or jogging.<br /><br />Con: charging cord is very short; loops that go over the ear is toooo big.  It was made for someone with big ears or at least made for men.

"I own one of these and I absolutely agree with other comments I've seen about the inability to view the display during daytime brightness.  It is almost impossible to see during the day, even with white (which seems to be the color which is most visible during the day.) I put this into a 2002 Honda Civic which I am giving to my son but with the display almost invisible during the day, I have safety concerns.  I contacted the place I purchased this, Crutchfield, and was told that in certain vehicles, if the angle of mounting (which you can't really control) isn't just right the daytime display is rendered almost unusable. It's all about the viewing angle. So make sure you purchase with a good return policy and try it in your car and see if the display is viewable during the day.<br /><br />Overall, the sound of the unit is good and the USB feature is great.  I find the controls to be not intuitive to use (and, of course, this is complicated if you need to change any settings during the day when you can barely see the display.)  I guess I'm used to all of my factory radios turing on and off with a touch of the volume control.  Not so with this unit. Pushing the volume control brings up the settings options.  You have to push the Src button (not so easy to see) and push it just right to power down the radio rather than changing sources.  I think Pioneer could have done a better design job (perhaps with a dedicated settings button?)  Also, there is no quick way to adjust the equalizer (bass, treble, etc.)  You have to go into settings, and then find the audio setting, and then make your changes.  Overall, for me, I find the design of the buttons, settings, etc. to be less than ideal.",neutral,positive

"I ordered the 43 Inch/110 Centimeter Light Reflector. It comes in it's own little zippered bag. The fabric appears to mostly be nylon, so it should wash easily with a damp cloth. The stitching is solid. I didn't know what to expect, but the Light Reflectors are exactly as pictured. My only little gripe is I had to refer to the listing to remember how to fold it to fit back into the pouch. Once you remove it, you have a large disk, silver on one side, black on the other. This has another zipper on the side. Inside the reflector's zipper is a diffuser which you will need to remove from the larger pouch to use. This is where the mounting tab is located. You will need the mounted clip that is available as part of the kit, or you may purchase it separately.  That's not all. The large, outer pouch is reversible, so you then reverse the large pouch and you have a gold reflector one one side or a solid white on the opposite side. This is how you have black, white, gold, silver and a diffuser all in one. The diffuser has it's own tap to clip on your tripod, which pokes through from a button hole to mount the entire piece. You will need to make sure it's pulled through if you remove the outer layer of the reflector.<br /><br />This is a good purchase for the value. I'm a hobbyist, and sometimes take photos of my projects. My problem comes from being a night-shift worker. I live and work at night. I must make my own lighting setup if I want to photograph anything at night, even in my home. It's light weight, and folds to a small circle, so this is also portable. It weighs less than a pair of jeans.<br /><br />Here's a free tip: Only use the gold if your subject is brown. I don't find the gold reflector so useful. I'm glad it's available, but I doubt it will get much use for me. Also, place the reflector in a way that would mimic the sun's light, and your subject will look more natural. This is where the clips and extension arms from your tripod can come in handy if you are working solo. Of course, you can always enlist the assistance of another for outdoor shoots. Sometimes this is a best option if it's available. In the movies, they tend to show someone holding a reflector with it facing up towards the subject, but that's only because it does look silly holding a big disc over your head. If you hold it, you will need to hold it up over your head, and it will look silly but your photos will not.<br /><br />It's a good tool to have on hand for any level of photography. I mostly photograph my doll collection. Once or twice a year, our doll collectors group will gather outdoors for shoots. We've not had a reflector available to us before, so this will help us immensely finding good spots to make photographs, even if the clouds are moving or we want to setup under trees.<br /><br />I also ordered the 2-pack clips. These are nice because they come with an adapter on them. If you remove the threaded black female cylinder and threaded ring, you are left with a standard sized male mount that will fit a tripod base. You do not need to make a separate purchase for an adapter, it's already there. The ball joint swivels all the way around and there is a groove in the base to tilt the clip in towards the base, so you can use these clips for holding the reflectors, diffuser or even a backdrop on a side or top mount adapter of your backdrop frame.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review. I hope you found it helpful.",positive,positive

"I bought this to upgrade the 300 watt power supply in my Dell Inspiration 530, and this for the sake of adding a new video card (no luck yet). It would be nice if the seller told us how many and and the type of power leads that come attached and the number of rails (I assume 1 if more are not listed).  My Dell has a 24 pin motherboard power supply recepticle. I have 2 hard drives and 2 opticals (Ok, I don't need 2 opticals). The hard drives and the opticals all require SATA power connectors. This Antec power unit comes with 2 SATA power supply connectors only. And it has a 20 pin mother board connector so you will have to plug in the 4 pin connector to fill all 24 on the MB if you have a 24 pin mobo recepticle). There are otherwise plenty of the older style connectors-maybe too many. I can hopefully use this in an older machine where the ps just died (overkill when replacing a 250w ps), but be forewarned, it comes w/ only 2 SATA connectors and a 20 pin motherboard connector. You could add an adapter ([...]), but my Dell PS unit came w/ 4 SATA plugs.

This solves the connection problem.  After that… e.g. after a stop and restart it connects in under a minute.  That initial connection is what bothers me. If, for example, I am on a road trip and leaving from a hotel to an interstate ramp only blocks away, I will need directions immediately.  That could be an issue and the reason I removed one star.",positive,neutral
"Firstly, I'm not an avid PC gamer and the PC I used this in used almost entirely as a HTPC/network storage PC. The installation could not have gone smoother, fired up and went right to work. The ""tweaking"" software leaves a little to be desired but does the job. I immediately started throwing Blu-ray movies at it and it performed flawlessly with even graphic intense 3D movies. When it is really pushed it shows it's weaknesses but I doubt 99.9% of home theater aficionados will even get to that point much less notice. When the gaming PC in the house lost it's power supply I didn't hesitate to allow our kids to play on the HTPC and it performed as I imagined it would which is: great on minecraft, poorly on newer FPS games such as battlefield.<br />After having this video card for 9 months it overheated while watching Avengers 3d blu ray and cooked itself. Now comes the strange part... nvidea ran me through a battery of test to troubleshoot the issue, they determined the card was bad. They then sent me links to contact EVGA Europe (living overseas) and instructed me how to warranty it. It took about 30 minutes for all that. Big thumbs up to Nvidea customer support. Then EVGA had a chance to drop the ball and in what could be the most shocking move by a computer video card manufacturer, they walked me through the RMA process and approved the whole warranty in about 24hours. That NEVER happens. I have been building PCs for 10 years and the service from Nvidea and EVGA was stellar. So now the kids gaming PC has lost its Radeon 7750 card until mine is returned from warranty, never tried this card in the HTPC but it actually does provide quite a boost to Blu-ray 3D movies.<br />To summarize: great for low level gaming and all but the highest level of home theater video playback, ridiculously low priced and awesome service from Nvidea and EVGA.",neutral,positive

"At this day in age, USB drives are all over the place.  Everyone and their grandmother makes them and can be found anywhere.  Personally, I've owned a handful ranging from high performance ones (from Corsair with excellent throughput) to generic ones (given to you as swag at conferences).  But of all the ones I've owned, I've also seen them fail (mainly the generic ones).  Nothing is worse than data loss and when relying on a USB drive for presentations/file transfers, you can't have one go bad on you at the wrong time.  With that said, I typically go with brand name USB drives for reliability.<br /><br />For speed and performance, there are specific ones I look to but for everyday file storage, I go with SanDisk.  SanDisk has been making memory cards for years and I've used them more than any other brand in all my devices, such as my phones & Android tablets.  When my dad needed a USB drive to store/transfer some high resolution photos from his DSLR camera, I got him this one.<br /><br />The price per gigabyte is average compared to other manufacturers, but you get the reliability of SanDisk.  I have yet for ANY of my SanDisk devices to fail and I've collected quite a few of them over the years.<br /><br />If you need a USB drive, give SanDisk a try.",positive,negative

"I gave this product a review of two stars because the drive itself is good, but Lexar doesn't seem to honor rebates (it looks like other people had similar results). I like the functionality of the hardware itself: it's fairly fast, portable, and reliable. However, one of the main reasons I bought it was because of a $$$ rebate. Unfortunately, Lexar claims I mailed in the paperwork too late. I know this is untrue because I'm meticulous about rebates: I carefully read the fine print and make photocopies of all the materials in case a problem should arise. However, there's no way to prove when I mailed in the rebate, so I'm pretty much out of luck. To prospective buyers: I would not expect to get a rebate check in the mail.",negative,positive

"Photo shows DVD insertion and ejection at SIDE EDGE of unit, but the slot is actually well behind the edge on the back at about the 1/3 point of the unit width.  As such, if the unit is mounted on a wall, one cannot easily insert or recover a DVD.  Sound quality is poor, so auxiliary speakers are essential for adequate quality and volume.  Packaging for shipment was inadequate to prevent damage to the DVD eject mechanism from a likely package drop on the opposite side edge.  Picture quality is very good.  However, the edge frame obscures a small portion of the DVD image all around, so some DVD graphics near the edge on the original do not show properly.",negative,negative
"These binoculars are big, weigh 4 pounds, have lots of magnification and a narrow field of view. They are not something to just carry with you to a football game.

You must have a tripod and attach them to it. Therefore, the adaptor is CRITICAL, and this one is all but useless.

"Bought the 32gb version on Amazon day at a fantastic price. Chose this model size primarily for comfortable and easy viewing of movies, videos while traveling and as one device alternate for Kindle books and listening to music at the gym. Love the size, pixel clarity and expansion memory slot (bought 128gb micro SD card too). From the factory, this tablet is clearly set up to simplify Amazon-centric activities like shopping, reading Kindle stuff, viewing/listening to prime media, etc, and it's well organized for those tasks. However, since the operating system is Android and I'm an Android guy, I also performed a few system tweaks to enable loading Google play store and several apps from there. I use Nova launcher and a launcher switcher to change my home screen view between the factory Amazon Fire screen and a customized more Google oriented homescreen that looks like my cell phone screen. Compared to my wife's iPad mini, the Fire HD 8 suits my needs perfectly for 60% lower cost. The only real downside is the very low quality camera... Pretty much useless. But, the camera is not why I got the fire tablet. The Fire HD 8 is a really well made, value priced budget tablet that performs it's intended functions reliably.

The &#34;no hassle&#34; exchange is not no hassle. 50 minutes on the phone with a succession of three customer service representatives with long periods on hold. Bottom line is that you have to ship the Kindle back. If they don't get it in 14 days, you have to start the return process all over again. Amazon has five days to repair or replace and then ship to you. There is also a series of absurd questions when you consider that the Kindle was used by a two year old: how did she break it, etc. My impression is that Amazon wants to make the &#34;no hassle&#34; replacement as difficult as possible to discourage returns.",negative,negative

Also by looking at the photos I thought that the top of the cover might have just a little bit of texture because of the diagonal lines (looks like fabric) but it looks like it's just print and smooth on the surface.

"I had wanted these for a while. While they can be great for some in my case they missed the mark and hopefully will improve.<br /><br />I'll skip the fluff and give the pros and cons.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Great fit out the box. Form fitting and doesn't protrude much at all and looks stylish as can be for ear buds.<br /><br />Sound reproduction is incredible. Not to much highs or lows in my opinion for my taste.<br /><br />Charging case is very minimal and almost forgot had them in my pocket.<br /><br />I do like the jabra app let's you know battery of both the buds and case, by percentage, so you know when you can or need to charge.<br /><br />Three features I like is.. 1)pressing left ear selection can be set to pause audio with background noise pass through or mute with pass through. This comes in handy when someone wants to talk to you, you don't have to take them out. (2)you can leave the pass through on, that way when working or outside you can still hear what's going on and the music, not on or other. (3)when you take one out of ear it will pause the music for 1 minute or when you put them back in, it will auto resume.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Unfortunately the big con for me is, in my opinion not ""true"" wireless... Meaning you can use both or just the right....but you can not use the left solo. That was a deal breaker for me. At times I need a longer battery life so when they can operate solo, if need, I can use one and charge the other... You can't do that with this.<br /><br />Other con was sound volume. I don't need ear drum busting loudness or base, but it sounded like was about 20-30 lower than other earbuds.<br /><br />If you don't need them solo or to be independent, like the sound volume decent then you'll love these.  Otherwise I would suggest others. I personally am keeping my Anker SoundCore Liberty Pro 2 as my everyday driver still. Only thing it lacks is the pass through option.",neutral,positive

"We purchased our LG 3D tv in November of 2011 mainly because of the good reviews and 3D capability. The 3D performance when watching 3D movies (the 10 that are available) is really good as long as you are at the correct distance. Make sure you are not more than 10ft. from the TV or the 3D doesn't seem very three dimensional. The 2D to 3D converter is a joke. It really don't make anything 3D, it just makes the picture blurry and gives you a headache!<br /><br />The clarity of the TV was very good until the display went dead about a month ago. We have never had a TV go bad before but 3 or 4 calls to LG got things moving in the warranty department. They contracted a local company who wanted to charge us a fee to repair the televison under warranty. After another couple calls to LG, they got around to finding someone else to do in-home repair for free. Well, it's been a month and we are still chasing after the repair guy who claims to have ordered the part. We were finally tired of waiting so we went out and purchased a Vizio 65"" for $1000.00 less. So far the Vizio is just as good as the LG. It's not 3D capable but we could never use the 3D on our LG set anyway. The wireless on the Vizio seems much faster and the remote has a keypad which is nice when you are looking for movies online.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this LG unless you want to spend an extra $1000.00 on a tv with no real warranty and 3D that you may or may not be able to use in 5 years!",negative,positive

"We bought two dozen of these for our office for workstation authentication.  They are like big pieces of jewelry with a heavy metallic body, a coated optical surface and a long USB cable that will extend from your PC on the floor to a desk.  Really beautiful. And, when they are set up with a driver and biometric software, they work really well.<br /><br />BUT... this is not a consumer product.  At all.  Software and support are for larger customers with a dedicated IT person or developer.  It is not really appropriate for Amazon to sell this device without anything to make it work.<br /><br />If you buy this, you will not be able to just plug it in and have Windows automatically install a driver.  Instead, expect to do quite a bit of searching for drivers.  The company that &#34;supports&#34; the UareU has many software updates and SDK updates but not the actual drivers or a free download of the SDK.  Our software vendor already developed an application so we can log in to their suite using a fingerprint.  But developing a login script for our domain involves getting a driver from another vendor and getting Windows to recognize the device first.  Then, using a software developer kit we (meaning our IT specialist) are developing a login script.  There may be simpler methods; Lenovo uses the UareU for their biometric scanner and you may be able to use their driver and\or application.<br /><br />The bottom line:<br /><br />This is not plug and play.  It seems a bit odd for this item to be sold retail without any freely available driiver or software.  I have heard from a smaller developer that the UareU was sold retail with software, but the company couldn't or wouldn't handle the volume of support requests. So they just stopped providing software. If you want to use one of these I suggest doing your homework, a lot of it, before you purchase one.  I'm giving this device three stars: five for the physical hardware and how well it works when it has software, one star for software availability and support.  It is really more appropriate for developers who have been hired to make biometric login possible for specialized applications like retail and medical offices.",neutral,positive
"Technically, they work, sometimes.<br />As I write this I have the app on my phone open and watching the cameras, except that I'm not actually seeing the cameras, I'm seeing an empty screen where the cameras would be.  Why?  Not sure, but they do not consistently feed video, at all.  In a given amount of time both cameras will work, then the feed will die, then it will come back on and die again, ad infinitum.  This is obviously not what is wanted for something that's used for either surveillance or for motion tracking.  The reviews of this show 3.5/5 stars, let that be a warning to you, these are unreliable and frustrating to work with.  The D-Link app is equally as terrible, the UI is unintuitive and difficult to get setup properly, once setup it prefers looking at the cameras through the cloud vs locally, which is not necessary if I'm at home.  This gets 2 stars for the fact that it will sometimes provide video, but it's not reliable and the app sucks.<br /><br />Oh, and if you want to view the cameras in your browser using their built in web server, you might want to find Microsoft Internet Explorer or Edge and put that icon back on your task bar.",negative,negative

I paid full price and I’m writing this review simply because this 1ByOne 35 Mile Range HDTV Antenna exceeded my expectations in every way possible. I’m very pleased with the 20ft long coaxial cable so I could place the antenna near the front door. It has a nice neat look that doesn’t stick out like a sore thumb. The channels auto programmed very quickly once the antenna was connected. I live in a metropolitan area and I now receive approximately 42 channels, all local and many of which I’ve never heard of before. Check out my photos and video to see how clearly the channels come in now. These channels were fuzzy, had a lot buzzing sounds and froze often prior to having this antenna. I would definitely recommend this antenna if you’re interested in cutting the cable cord. Thanks to this antenna, I’m saving $209 a month now that I don’t need Comcast.

"These headphones are just kinda *Meh.* They're not terrible... Granted they don't come even close to a higher end pair, but they aren't great either. The plastic feels flimsy and cheap and they don't come with a case or any real way to protect the headphones so you'll for sure want to get a case... and once you add the expense of a case you might as well just buy a more expensive pair that comes with a case. The sound quality is pretty good for the price point. I like that there are controls for volume built right into the headphones. Overall they're ok, but definitely didn't blow my socks off.",neutral,positive

"I tried a different tablet in a class and loved it.  I did some research and looked at my bank account and bought the small tablet.  Someday, I will justify buying a larger tablet.  I tried to use it a few times and had difficulty putting the pen in the right place to trace lines.  I read some tips online on how to get comfortable with the tablet and one suggestion was to write words with it and practice your signature.  Within minutes, I had mastered getting the pen to go where I wanted it and was able to trace an image.<br />There are four hot keys that I don't use because I haven't memorized what they do yet.  One day, I'll focus on learning them.  My only issue is that I can't get the touch feature to work if I have certain settings in place.  I can get it to work sometimes, but then I keep accidentally zooming or moving the object around on the screen.  I don't really need the touch settings, so it doesn't bother me; if it did, I would look up how to fix it.<br />If you are a beginner/student, this is great way to find out if a tablet is for you.  If you are advanced or use a tablet frequently, buy a larger or more advanced tablet.",positive,positive

"I'm going to start with the negative and get around to the positive so take this how you will. These are not waterproof. Get the idea out of your head that these will withstand rain. Attached picture 1 is water that's on the inside of the lens and cannot be cleaned out. These are water resistant meaning a light rain, hitting it with a hose for a minute, etc will be fine. You need to mount these under cover or build something over them. Water will seep in from where the cable goes in and it will destroy your camera. You will get back a message from support that they're not waterproof.<br /><br />Next, the POE ethernet connection with the waterproof capsule is... once again, not waterproof. Once you've got your POE connected invest in tape and tape the crap out of it. I had at least 4 of the units fry from water intrusion. Make absolutely sure the camera's ethernet cable is pointing DOWN and not sideways. Water won't flow into it.<br /><br />Next, that firmware that ships with them usually is not the latest. It's also not particularly robust. I set these cameras to update via NTP and after a few months I still have to go in and reset them. Not sure what's up with that but it's been a running issue.<br /><br />I've chucked probably 5 of the bullet cameras and 3 of the dome at this point. Water has always been the culprit. I've siliconed the units, built roofs for them, and generally have relegated these to only places that are covered. Because they work great when they're not exposed to the elements.<br /><br />I've ordered more for work, they are good, don't get me wrong...<br /><br />But trust me on the ethernet port always having to be pointed down. Had a break in the sheathing of the connecting ethernet cable, water got in, flowed right over, burned the plug out. Had another unit I trusted the connector capsule for, nope... water got in, burned the plug out.<br /><br />So treat it as though it can take a splash but yeah, not ideal for outdoors without some work, and you're going to want additionally silicone gel, tape, and a roof or shelter over the camera.",neutral,positive

Not horrible, just not as good. Someday I might splurge for the OEM pads.",neutral,positive
"Gigabyte MoBos, use to have a good reputation and good quality. I have 2 Pcs with Gigabyte motherboards for over 6 years, and both have performed fairly Ok, albeit the Z97 have glitches in the onboard HDMI, the other one lost the onboard Ethernet. After this recent purchase of an H370M D3H, for a new build, with everything new; it had a completely dead onboard graphics zero out of 3: One AVI, One HDMI, and One VGA, all three dead. Caused me to check on all possible faults, praying not to be the MoBo; after check all: PS, Memory sticks and slots, Monitor; when installed a PCI-e Video Card, the card worked Ok. So Mobo was defective; sent it back and got an exact model replacement, after a week lost, incredible, same exact problem!! Left the video card installed and gave up. No matter how much tried updating Bios, and setting onboard graphics to Enable or Auto, just plain DEAD.<br />I would not recommend this particular board to anyone! Paid a 2nd board to finally keep it defective; could not afford keep waiting for the ""Lottery good"" H370 D3H, a very disappointing build. An by the way this is not my first PC built, probably the #25, but indeed the only one with a garbage onboard graphics motherboard 2 times in a row! I don't think the seller at this point, could do other than just giving me a partial credit for my ordeal and having a new PC with a PCI-e card in order to work. if I charge for my wasted time for the last 13 days of trial, wait and error, I would be quite a lot more.",negative,negative

I wish there was a way to add other things that we use in our house such as iHeart Radio (much better than pandora in my opinion). Netflix is great. It recently updated to allow you to access your favorites list, which it didn't do when I first started using it.DVD and Blu-Ray playback is great as well, though we use it for Netflix more than anything.

I got this for my case which I cannot use due to size. I did installed it in my son's case. You would need a large case with plenty of clearance to mount. I have a Cooler Master 690 II.  I also do recommend to not use the stick on velcro it comes with. It did not hold. But the oddest thing is the molex to power it comes with (1) female and (1) male molex connector. So if you do not have a female connector in your case you will need to buy an adapter and may even have to splice it. But all in all after all of that it lights realy good and looks great. Oh and plan well on placing the little blue power converter box. Do not commit sticking until all panel door close without interferance. This is why I gave it 3 stars.,neutral,positive

"While I found this 500GB drive to be amazingly small, lightweight and highly portable, I did not get anywhere near the speeds promised in the specs. I ran multiple benchmarks on two of my PCs and was never able to get past 100MB/s on short bursts, with averages being more like 60-70MB/s.<br /><br />Each was bench tested with all antivirus and antispyware temporarily disabled. Disk encryption on the drive was NOT enabled, which should have provided maximum speed. Attached are screenshots from both computers using using a variety of different USB 3.0 cables, including the one that came with the Samsung drive. All cables seemed to provide the same amount of throughput, so I am ruling out the provided cable as part of the problem. Disk was set up and formatted per Samsung instructions.<br /><br />Despite doing everything &#34;by the book&#34; multiple tests across different machines, with different cables on different versions of the Windows operating system all gave pretty much the same results.By contrast, I ran the same benchmark utility on each of my internal SSDs and they each clocked-in at between 300-450MB/s.<br /><br />One other item that bothered me... Samsung loads some sort of proprietary driver on my PC that stays on ALL the time, even when the external drive is disconnected.

Since I almost never rate higher than four stars (an item has to be extra good and let's face it, this is just a bluray player that I wouldn't have even bought if my older model wasn't going to stop being supported by YouTube as of three days ago), this one is only landing a three star review.

"Full disclosure: I was offered a free product in exchange for a 5 star review. This offer did not affect my ultimate determination that the product is worth a 5 star rating. I would not have accepted the offer had I not independently believed this product to be worthy of 5 stars.<br /><br />I received all 4 protectors, the cloths, the wipes, and the guide stickers packaged nicely. I’ve had screen protectors like this in the past and it’s important to understand their purpose - to protect your screen.<br /><br />Yes, they will scratch. Most importantly, however, your screen will not. I crashed my bike with a screen protector on (not this product, a different one I previously owned) and it was totally shattered. I can only imagine what would have happened to the screen without it. They are not as scratch-resistant as the actual Garmin screen but that’s not going to happen for this price. Even the Garmin itself, however, is easily susceptible to scratches - I originally ordered screen protectors because I got a big scratch on mine without even noticing what caused it. With the protectors, you just slap a new one on and you’re good to go. Getting 4 for only $7 is totally worth it.<br /><br />They will be more reflective than the screen, yes, but it didn’t really affect real-world use. Once I got used to it the reflectively wasn’t a big deal.<br /><br />They will smudge and show fingerprints. So does my actual Garmin. Either way you’re gonna have to deal with it.<br /><br />This particular product has nicely curved edges - nothing sharp. They feel smooth and you wouldn’t even notice it was on the watch unless someone told you it wasn’t there. It’s easy to apply and can be easily removed without any residue when you want to switch it out. Basically you can have a brand-new looking screen whenever you want.<br /><br />I wish I had a protector on when I first scratched my Garmin. I didn’t and it’s bugged me ever since. If I didn’t have a screen protector when I crashed my bike then there’s a good chance my watch would have been sent back to Garmin for a new screen at my expense - $100 and I would have been without a watch until it was repaired. Getting 4 means I can switch a protector out whenever it doesn’t look new anymore.",positive,positive

"If you are going to make and market a tablet case as a universal case for 8-inch Samsung Galaxy tablets, one would expect that it would fit said tablets. Unfortunately this is not so. This case does not fit the 8-inch Samsung Galaxy Note 8. The case is not wide enough for the Note 8, and if it fit, the volume buttons would be partially blocked by that bump-holder on the right side. It will certainly not fit any of the newer 8-inch Samsung Galaxy tablets with the 4:3 (iPad) aspect ratio (Tab A, Tab S2) since those are even wider than the Note 8.<br /><br />So make sure you try the case first, or buy from places that offer hassle-free returns in case it doesn't fit. Don't be fooled by the universal. The description does not exclude any models and as of review time, I can't find details on this on the manufacturers website.<br /><br />The case only props up the tablet in landscape mode, using a trifold cover mechanism. Inside, the tablet is held in place by four semi-soft straps that have some agility to accommodate slight variations in tablet size. There's also a roadblock type of a bump on the right side, under 2.5 inches long. The case has medium thickness, it is not featherweight, but it's not a thick tank either.<br /><br />I am not sure how sturdy the outside of the front cover will be. With very gentle use (trying to fit the tablet in), and already a small piece scraped off, revealing white material underneath.<br /><br />I've used Belkin cases before, overall this one does not feel like it is at the same level.

"I've seen spotty reviews on the technology, but I had a need at home and on several client sites for a bridge option the tech offered, so I decided to try it out. After many hours of isolating circuits, disassembling the service box to determine the bus bar phase layout, etc. I gave up on the units due to intermittent and slow connectivity. The software that came with them was clunky, slow and resource intensive and did nothing to assist with connection diagnosis.

"I picked up this router without doing much research, and that's the last time I'm ever going to do that. When it worked, it was great, but it would often kill the signal (wired and wireless) and require a restart. However, I could live with having to restart it every now and then, but just the other day it died. I picked up this router in September of last year, and I could only make it as for as 6 months. In short, this router is now worse than my 5 year old Linksys router. Now I'm left stranded with 6 devices (4 wired/2 wireless) with only a connection from my modem. With that said, I'm heading out right now to find a replacement. I've never gone through a router this fast. Avoid this model at all costs, unless you don't have to share your internet connection.",negative,negative
"My wife purchased this for me for Father's Day 2016. I decided on the Sony mainly because Apple's selection of iPods is lousy. I was looking for a basic mp3 player that had enough storage to hold my entire music library (roughly 20GB). I have an older iPod Nano but got tired of being limited to only loading part of my music library. The new iPod Nano would have been perfect if it was offered in something larger than 16GB. I refused to buy a iPod Touch, as I didn't want to buy what is essentially old iPhone technology just to store more than 16GB of music. Additionally, I wanted something smaller to carry when working out. Carrying what is basically an iPhone did not appeal.<br /><br />So I found this Sony. Read everything I could find on it. The reviews were largely positive so I sent the link to my wife. In our house, we only have two Macs for computers. We got rid of our last PC years ago. I hooked the Walkman up to our iMac that contains my music library. The Mac instantly recognized the Walkman as a drive and I was able to copy my entire library to the Walkman with ease. I was happy.<br /><br />Last night I decided to try and transfer some of my iTunes playlists to the Walkman. After about 2 hours of trying and watching every video I could find, I walked away frustrated and unsuccessful. Essentially the only way to get playlists on the Walkman is to use Sony's content transfer program. Unfortunately, Sony has not released a version of this program that works with OS X El Capitan. The program will install but it is unable to &#34;see&#34; the Walkman; thus will not transfer anything. I tried downloading the newest version of content transfer and it still does not work. To add to the frustration, when you go to the Sony support page for the NW-A27HN, there is no software listed as available. You basically have to search the internet for the software and hope the link you find is to the newest version. Obviously it doesn't matter if you get the newest version since it still doesn't work with El Capitan.<br /><br />After failing to transfer playlists, I figured I could manually make one on the Walkman itself. Unfortunately, that feature does not exist. If it does, I was unable to figure out how to do it or find documentation on how to do it.<br /><br />So what it boils down to is Sony wants you to use a PC for managing your Walkman music. Their limited support for Mac computers does not work with an operating system that's been out for months. Additionally, Sony has opted to make the playlist feature unusable without their proprietary software.<br /><br />The Walkman sounds good and has a good interface, aside from the playlist issue. I am not an Apple Fan Boy by any means. That said, I feel like Sony could put a little more effort into supporting Mac users. It could only help with Sony's Walkman sales if Apple users knew they weren't limited to partial compatibility.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I do not have the packaging for the Walkman or I'd probably return it. Even if I did return it, I don't know what I would get instead since the selection of mp3 players is limited.<br /><br />If adding playlists becomes available in the future, I will edit my review and rating. For now, I am disappointed.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Update #1 7/02/2016<br /><br />I have bumped my rating up to 5 stars. Refusing to give up, I uninstalled Sony's content transfer software and re-installed it. For whatever reason, I plugged the Walkman in to the computer and after a few seconds, content transfer recognized it. It hadn't worked the last 10 times I tried it so I'm not sure why it worked now. Anyway, I was able to drag and drop a playlist from iTunes and it showed up in the playlist menu of the Walkman.<br /><br />I next drag and dropped two different podcasts from iTunes and they were correctly put into the podcasts folder on the Walkman. The Walkman even created folders for them since they were from two different &#34;Artists.&#34;<br /><br />So it looks like, at the moment, my combination of OS X (10.11.5) and content transfer (1.3.11230) software versions are working together.<br /><br />My only request for Sony at this point is to make the newest version of content transfer easier to find for a specific device. As I mentioned before, if you navigate to the &#34;Software&#34; link for this Walkman, there is nothing listed. A user shouldn't have to search the web for software that is needed for a specific device when there is a support page for that device.<br /><br />I am a lot happier with the Walkman now that the software is working. It serves as a legitimate alternative to the iPod Nano that lacks storage and the iPod touch that is too big for my use. The Micro SD card slot further increases its value as storage is not almost unlimited when used for music.<br /><br />I will update this review if any functions or my opinion change.",positive,positive

"It's a neat little duster, but for the price, I will have to dock a star. The price along with the Jet Engine description in the listing...

"The price for these bands are great, but I'm not really happy with the purchase.  If faced with the decision to buy them again, I wouldn't.  The colors are nice, but a couple of them feel weird.  Not sure how to explain it, but let me try.  I mainly bought this set for the blue band, but it either has some weird film coating it, is covered in some sort of powder or the texture is just too soft, because it is impossible to keep clean.  I'm not sure how to explain it, but the finish isn't just normal plastic.  It collects dust and particles immediately.  I tried to wash it with soap and water numerous times hoping to get the texture to change or remove any film or powder that may be covering it, but it just didn't work.  The grey one is very similar, but it isn't as bad.  I haven't tried the black one, but the slate band is very similar to the blue one in that it just doesn't stay clean.  I had a similar non-name brand white band I bought off Amazon over a year ago and I had no problems with it staying clean.  It eventually got beat up from all the wear and tear, which is why I wanted to get more replacement bands.  Figured this 4 pack would be a good addition, because I wanted the blue and grey bands.  I'm not picky, so when I say they won't stay clean, it's because it is very noticeable and not appealing.",negative,positive

Similarly the buttons are recessed such that you need to use a screwdriver or similar to press them.<br /><br />As others have mentioned the construction is also very flimsy. The layers are all very thin acrylic & I had one break while assembling. Similarly the plastic screws don't hold up. One broke after a few loosening & tightenings (disassembly is the only way to get to the sd slot).  Also using the raw screw bottoms as feet (instead of rubber feet) means the case can't be used directly on a finished surface.",negative,negative
"I purchased the system with high hopes, as I have owned Uniden products in the past. I spent much time researching wireless camera systems before the purchase. I knew that there would be some limitations with the wireless system, but I hoped it would be still be adequate.  My experience was that this system may be sufficient if it is not asked to do to much. I set both cameras on either side of my garage to monitor my driveway, which is not visible from any point in my house. Even though the cameras were less than 50' from the monitor, the picture was so fuzzy it was hard to make out. The signal the cameras were putting out was not strong enough to keep the image from dropping out on the monitor, in spite of trying to relocate the cameras.<br /><br />Also of note, on two occasions I woke up in the morning to find that one of the cameras was completely off line, not transmitting any signal at all. It was not until I unplugged the camera and reinserted the power cord that the camera would reboot and send signal. Each camera did it to me once, and each was plugged into a different outlet. This was particularly disappointing as I bought the system to monitor my residence while out of town via the web application (which worked well by the way).  With camera dropping out and no one available to unplug and reset t them, they would be of no use to me.<br /><br />If you wanted to monitor an indoor smaller area, they would probably work fine. But asking them to transmit a good usable signal through walls consistently is probably out of their capability. I reluctantly returned the system with no hassles (than you Amazon!) and ordered a wired system. It has been installed for a few days now and is working great with a crystal clear picture.  Just be reasonable on what you ask this system to do.",neutral,positive

Instructions understandable, mount to wall with screws or use adjustable straps around tree or pole- I like that.  Took no time to set-up.  Next test, will it hook up to wifi and phone?  Yes, to both.  I'm happy.  But... it had an immensely hard time picking up the signal.

The best attributes of this case are its fit and  protection. The iPod screen is completely covered/protected by this model, unlike other versions I've seen of a similar design. Only the click-wheel is left exposed, and that's a good thing.<br /><br />Highly recommended for your Nano fifth generation.",positive,positive

"I bought this system because like everyone else, my TV sound was pretty weak.  I didn't want to deal with running speaker wires all over so I went with the sound bar.  Its definitely easy to set up with my Sony TV and the sound is better than the TV.  But it isn't as good as I was expecting from reading all the other reviews.  I wish I could use the sound bar along with the TV speakers but using the pass-through the sound is off just slightly and creates a slight echo.  Seems like I need to adjust the volume quite a bit more when switching channels or playing a DVD than I did with just the TV sound.  Some channels are good at 14 and some I have to crank up to 40.",neutral,positive

"Excellent build quality. Just what I needed to mount one end of my camera sling strap to. For those of you with a Panasonic Lumix FZ300/330 looking for a QR plate that won't interfere with opening that camera's battery/memory card door, the DBT-60 will allow you to do that if you grind or file off one of its camera strap's mounting lugs. (The DBT-60 is made of aluminum.) The way I did it, I ground off the lug to the left of the horizontal slot and applied a couple of coats of flat-black paint to the ground off edge. After mounting the plate on the camera, slide it all the way to the right (so as the mounting screw is directly below the &#34;DTB-60&#34; printed on the bottom of the plate—see attached photo). The removed camera strap lug then allows the access door to open and close freely while the camera is still mounted onto the tripod. The remaining lug allows me to attach my sling strap, which I then carry over my left shoulder. Works perfectly for my needs. Oh, and don't forget to carry a two-bit piece in your pocket to tighten/loosen the mounting screw. (The DTB-60’s included Allen wrench can also be used to mount and unmount the plate, but a quarter won't poke a hole in your pocket like the Allen wrench might.)",positive,positive

The buttons on the volume and power are covered...i dont know if this is the design or a flaw...but they dont press in, at all, to activate either.  Everything flops out, flops around or slides off.  The keyboard was the added sell for me and it works as far as typing but after 2 uses the light stopped lighting.

It functions as advertised and installation was easy.  BUT... there is a tiny bit of space around the internal tray where it meets the housing.  They don't fit tightly together.  This allows the tray to shift slightly within the housing if you tilt the unit one way, then tilt it back.  There are two screws that attach the tray to the housing, but they're close to one end of the unit, allowing the tray to shift at the other end.  I'm concerned that this will allow too much vibration and ultimately cause drive problems, and I need absolute 100% reliability.

"Update: The unit has developed Wifi problems which Microsoft cannot fix.  It's now an intermittent connection, making all online activities frustrating.  It's frustrating to use for Skype, webmail, netflix... everything.  I've stopped using my Surface.  Therefore  5 stars down to 1.  Fix this Microsoft! :-(.<br /><br />I love this thing and you will too- but only if you get the whole package!<br /><br />My needs: My eternal frustration is the pain of having messy mountains of notes in paper legal pads, not being able to fully edit stuff on my android tablet, and then having most of the stuff on my laptop which I don't have with me most of the time.  This thing finally pulls together my paper notebook, desktop, and laptop so 100% of everything is at my fingertips and searchable 100% of the time.  Such a time saver and stress reducer!<br /><br />First, let me say that I only love it because I paid for the docking station and the keyboard; it's nothing without.  I work in an office where I'm in meetings 3-4 hours a day and traveling about 30% of the time.  I take this with me to all meetings and jot notes with the pen.  I've become addicted to OneNote, and don't miss the stress of desperately flipping through pages of pads to find what I wrote months ago.  (the pen works - it's the third stylus device I've owned and by far the first I found smooth enough to be useful- the hardware & software are both excellent - google about the 2 layer screen). When needed I flip it out keyboard and write.  It's just easy.  Finally, it's nice to always have my full computer available to effortlessly pull up info in the middle of the meeting.  Oh- and bootup takes about 5 seconds including opening OneNote with the stylus button (that one-click open is absolute genius!).  It's about the same as opening a journal and clicking a pen.  It's just easy.<br /><br />As for a computer?  The standalone laptop function works well enough - like the old netbooks.  I type just fine on the keyboard, but it doesn't hold a candle to modern Dell or Lenovo business machines.  Good for an hour meeting or an afternoon at the coffee shop?  Absolutely. Would I be happy with it as standalone laptop replacement?  Nope.  But that's where the docking station comes in!<br /><br />As soon as I return to my desk I just plop it into the docking station, which is on a 10&#34; laptop riser (lift).  I have a 24&#34; 1080p articulating monitor, logitec wireless keyboard & mouse.  The overall result is better than the last desktop I had.  It just works.<br /><br />Finally, the under 2 lb.  light weight is a lifesaver over the previous 6 lb. Dell I had.  When I include the chargers of both it's about 5 lb lighter- absolutely a life changer when traveling, especially with connections.  I'm a average fit 5'10&#34; guy, but throwing 8 lbs comp & charger in the bag & walking around for hours in airports... was just killing me.  I can hardly feel this thing in the bag - even with the little charger.  (Battery life is good for me (better than most laptops I've owned), but a full charge takes about 4 hrs).<br /><br />Also - the screen is delightful.  See it before you buy something else - very high res, very good contrast, viewing angle, good color saturation... If you preview this unit, then go look at a Note 4 phone; this is almost that good (assuming that you don't sit 8&#34; from your comp screen).  Best screen I've owned by far and among the top on the market.  IMHO, the saturation & contrasts is better than Macs.<br /><br />(Tiny side note- If the screen breaks, screen repair is, according to some online reviews, really difficult).<br /><br />If you just want a gaming computer this isn't it (although the i-7 beats other netbooks in benchmarks).  If you want a netflix machine then get something cheaper.  This to me is a tangible life quality & organization improvement - but without the docking station & keyboard don't bother.  If you're not willing to splurge for the docking station and if you don't currently want to replace paper note taking then just spring for a slightly cheaper Yoga.<br /><br />Final note: if I had the budget, everyone in my office would have a Surface 3 Pro w/ docking station & separate monitor.",negative,positive

"I have 3 of these exact model satellites. I didn't buy them from this exact location, but I have them and been using them for several months and felt it important to explain my experience. I originally bought these because my old mesh had so many devices attached that the router and satellites had to be rebooted often especially when adding additional devices. I have a smart home so almost every light switch and many outlets connect to the Wifi. I bought this Netgear mesh system which had 3 satellites and a router. I left the old mesh network in place and use it strictly as the backbone of my home light switches and power outlets only. The new WiFi 6 is used for all my devices such as TVs, Desktops, Laptops and Tablets. When I first installed these, everything seemed much better, fast reliable etc. HOWEVER, after using these for several months things have gone down hill. Certain satellites get very slow and everything connected to them drops to 25% the usual speed. Sometimes the LED on the satellite reflects the issue and goes from blue to orange, sometimes the satellite is having slow issues and remains blue. I've come to discover that unplugging the power and plugging it back in often resolves the issue. I've had to do this numerous times since I installed them. My home is only about 1300sqft and the router unit is not far from any of the satellites. I used to have a non-mesh that worked better than this mesh with the router far from my main desktop and I never had these issues. I personally am planning on looking for a different solution, this brand/model seems totally unreliable.",negative,positive

Since it doesn't synch, there is no way to know how much charge is left on your suitcase. And 75% of the screen is a picture of a link trying to get you to buy the Bluesmart 2. Poorly designed app, which makes me feel like this was put together in someone's basement, with little thought to logic.

It turns out that the connector on the display side is too SMALL than other standard laptops.<br />What does this mean? - It means that there is a high chance of the screen going kaput despite get it repaired, due to the small size of the connector, which reduces the durability of the connection, prone to break even by normal use (opening / closing of display cover), and thus a defective product.",negative,negative

"The AV100 do have a sharper design/look compared to others in it's class but I ultimatly returned these for the more known quantity: Bose A20.<br /><br />I feel the AV100 falls short on the quality of the control box and wire.It's a relatively thin and cheap feeling wire - same with the control box - cheesy feeling. It is also inferior to sound quality compared to the bose (marginally and that margin is eliminated if one headset fits better then the other for you personally!)<br /><br />I do feel the A20 produces a richer sound in both speech and music audio.  I also feel the A20 has better ANR whereas the AKG has an abundance of white noise, which, in a very quiet cockpit can get tiring but in a normal GA piston cockpit is not an issue.  The A20 is still the quieter headset.<br /><br />AKG audio & ANR is more on-par with lightspeed audio and ANR except for one aspect: Music.  AKG's bluetooth music audio blows away lightspeed's in my opinion.<br /><br />That all being said, AKG and Bose are very close.  For most it will come down to how each headset physically fits.  Everyone's head is different.  A lot of people I have talked to switched from the A20 to AKG because it was more comfortable for them.  I do not find this to be the case personally but can easily see how poor fit would ruin any marginal leg up any headset has in audio quality (I.E if you can't stand to wear it, what's the point of good audio in the first place?)<br /><br />If AKGs were closer to the $600-$700 mark they would be the better bang for the buck vs the A20s.  If the AKGs got rid of of the white noise they use in their ANR design, and made some small tweaks to the thickness of the cable and the feel of the control module then the AKGs would be the better of the two at the same price tag.",neutral,positive

"WiFi signal doesn't make it to furthest reaches of your home? Don't want to pull CAT5 cable through walls and ceilings and maybe have to punch a hole or two? Well, consider using your home's electrical wiring to transmit your signals.<br /><br /> It's an idea that has been around for quite some time, including for using municipal power lines for data transmission.<br /><br /> While this Belkin unit works, in my particular situation, I don't think it has a high utility value. My WiFi signal reaches everywhere in my unit - and even to some areas outside. My network speeds are acceptable for my needs, but might not be fast enough to satisfy someone else. If I needed additional coverage, I'd add another WiFi access point - or simply use one of the cables I strung before the days of usable WiFi.<br /><br /> So, what about this unit? It works, though it won't deliver 200Mbps (which Belkin acknowledges). The power brick must be plugged directly into the outlet: no extension cords, no power bars. For most two socket wall outlets, the power adapter is so big that it means the second outlet is rendered unusable.<br /><br /> Setup on the one port model is easy. Power up and plug the respective units in. That's it.<br /><br /> The one-port model is extremely limited, though, considering the limitations imposed by the power adapter's appetite for sockets. The three-port model is strongly urged.<br /><br /> Overall, this gadget works.

"The monitor feels a bit generic, but with the ease of its set-up, it all worked out fine. The only drawback is that the clarity of color and resolution of the monitor can only be seen with a direct, straight on view. Any other viewing angle gives a whitewashed view to the entire screen. That won't be a problem if this is your main screen. However, it might be an issue if you plan to use it as a secondary screen in a multi-monitor set up.  Also, the anchoring device to hold the monitor upright is at an extremely low angle. I had to prop up the two front metal feet up by about 3/4"" to view it. So this is not a high end monitor by any means, but it is fine for a low end one.",positive,positive

"On my Dell XPS laptop running windows 10 this Unitek USB hub was truly plug and play. The necessary drivers for both the hub and the Ethernet adapter were automatically installed when it was plugged it the first time. No other drivers were needed to be installed manually and no other configuration was needed for either the hub or the Ethernet adapter. On my 2015 MacBook Pro running OS X El Capitan the hub itself was plug and play and did not require any drivers to be installed. However, I did have to download and install the Ethernet driver from the Unitek website in order to use the Ethernet adapter on the Mac but no other configuration was needed.<br /><br />I verified on both my PC and Mac that the hub provide USB 3.0 speeds. I used an Adata UV150 USB 3.0 Flash drive for testing which is capable of up to 150MB/s read and up to 90MB/write speeds. To perform the benchmark I used the Blackmagic Disk Speed Test application on the Mac and the FlashBench application on my PC. In both cases I tested the USB drive connected directly to the USB 3.0 port of the computer and then connected to the Unitek USB 3.0 hub. The results confirmed that read and write access to the drive using the hub was as fast as when the drive was connected directly to the computer (150-190MB/s read and 70-90MB/s write speeds).<br /><br />All three of the USB ports on this hub are capable of BC1.2 charging which can provide ~1.5Amp when charging devices whereas a standard USB port can usually only provide 0.5 - 1.0 Amps. In order to charge your devices at the higher amperage you will need a 5V AC adapter which does not come with this hub. I already had a 5V/2Amp AC adapter that fit and I used that for testing along with a USB volt/amp meter and measured ~1.6Amps when charging an iPad.<br /><br />I also verified that the Ethernet adapter is capable of gigabit speeds. I used the Unitek Hub/Ethernet adapter with my MacBook (which does not have built-in Ethernet) and the built-in gigabit Ethernet port on my Dell laptop. Both devices were connected directly to my gigabit router via wired Cat5e. I then used the iperf3 network throughput/speed test utility on both the Mac and PC. I consistently got about 850Mbit/s speeds which confirms the adapter is capable of gigabit speeds. The Unitek Ethernet adapter has automatic crossover detection and I was able to transfer files between my PC and Mac using a standard Cat5e patch cable with no other NIC enabled and a crossover cable was not required.<br /><br />The individual on/off power switches on each of the thee USB ports is a nice bonus as well as the included USB type C adapter that will allow you to use it with newer devices that no longer come with standard USB ports. I received this Unitek USB Hub/Ethernet adapter for free in exchange for my feedback, testing, and review.",positive,positive

"Whether or not you'll like this case depends to a large extent on two things: 1) how much of a klutz you are, and 2) how you use your iPad.<br /><br />Here's where I fit into that picture:  I'm not generally klutzy -- I can count on one hand the number of times I've dropped any of my portable electronics in the past 10 years.  I use my iPad mostly when I travel and don't want to bring my laptop, and it stays in my bag unless I'm using it. Otherwise, I bring it out now and again for games or to read (I have the Kindle app installed, and it works great for that).  For me, this Otterbox case is probably a case of &#34;overkill&#34;: perhaps a little more case than I really need.<br /><br />The basics:<br />This is a multi-part case:  the two-piece inner plastic &#34;shell&#34; with a clear window over the screen, the outer silicone &#34;slipcover&#34; that hugs the back and sides of the plastic shell, and another hard plastic snap-on outer &#34;cover&#34; that includes a pop-up stand, that snaps onto the back of the silicone cover.<br /><br />The good:<br />This will definitely protect your iPad Pro 9.7.

The colors &#34;damson purple&#34; and &#34;hibiscus pink&#34; aren't too garish, either, and match the photos on the page here.<br /><br />The concern(s):  The only screen protection is the thin plastic &#34;screen protector&#34; -- that's all.  I'm a little concerned about how protective it would be in an accident.  It would have been really nice if they had designed the outer cover/stand to snap onto the FRONT of the case.  I've tried it a few times, and it doesn't work.  The corner &#34;clips&#34; get caught in the silicone slipcover so that it can't snap securely.  It only fits securely onto the BACK of the case.  Pity.<br /><br />Also, it's VERY heavy.  I realize that you don't get this level of protection without adding weight, so that's a trade-off that you either choose to live with or not.<br /><br />Soooo ... bottom line:  if you have klutzy tendencies, if you're looking for 5-star protection for your iPad Pro and you're willing to live with added weight, this might be a super option.  If you're more like me -- light user, not of the klutzy persuasion -- this might a little more protection than you really need.  For me, it rates 3 stars:  &#34;It's OK.&#34;",neutral,positive

"This device delivers video with a clear picture. It has good resolution and good lighting. It also gives a good picture when the flood lamps are off. It has somewhat good configuration options, and lets you select the area in which something should trigger a notification.<br /><br />However, it can't distinguish things well. It lets you select a mode that's supposed to recognize people, but it thinks that cats and skunks are people. They aren't. It's simply not practical to keep the notifications on at night or I'd be woken up nightly.<br /><br />It's supposed to be compatible with Alexa, but turning off notifications temporarily won't stop notifications from Alexa, if they are enabled. It can keep the app from alerting you temporarily, but there may be times when you don't want notifications and it's not practical to go into Alexa, disable it for each camera, and then remember to reenable all cameras individually at a later time. For example, if the gardener comes by, you probably wouldn't want to be notified every few minutes that he's in the backyard, in the side yard, etc.<br /><br />It works best if you have an account, and the prices are reasonable for a single camera. If you have three or more, it's worth getting the top plan, which will give you the most capabilities including an extended warranty. Without that, if you need something as simple as a replacement light, they won't sell you the replacement parts.",neutral,positive

"My iPad mini just arrived today and I used it without the screen protector first so I can compare how it looks with it installed.<br /><br />Installation is easy. I used the guide stickers and the cleaning kit included, no lint introduced on the screen. It easily took off the smudges I placed on the screen, making the cleaning process easy. The camera cutout is tricky though since it just fits exactly on the screen protector. Luckily didn’t have any issues with the front camera being covered.<br /><br />One thing you’ll notice right away is the amount of glare the screen protector produces. Not much issues if you’re indoors but once you’re outside or in a bright area, it’s definitely noticeable. I didn’t have that issue with a bare iPad screen.<br /><br />Another issue is the screen protector is a fingerprint magnet. The description says it has an oleophobic coating but it doesn’t seem to be the case. I was curious if there’s any film I might have left on the screen protector but there’s nothing. I’ve had older iPads and the screen protectors I used with it doesn’t smudge like this one. Plus, you need alcohol wipes to get the smudges off since plain microfiber doesn’t clean it well.<br /><br />I’ll wait for more reviews on the other screen protectors and maybe get a different one in the future.",neutral,positive

"Update - 11/16. 2 &#62;&#62; 3 stars. It looks like tplink read this review and fixed a few negatives...but it's still far from perfect.<br /><br />The Good:<br />+ Price - lowest in its class (when it's $50)<br />+ Coverage - 26dBm max tx is outstanding (US firmware version only)<br />+ Stable connection and has been relatively reliable<br />+ Included poe injector seems high quality<br />+ Can be managed through web ui and/or controller software<br />+ Many configuration settings<br />+ 2 year warranty<br /><br />The Bad:<br />- High latency - using only a single EAP access point, with a single client, on a very simple home network, in an environment with nearly zero interference, I was consistently getting over double the ping during speed tests of any other access point I have ever used - even tplink's own cheapest $20 consumer ap. I tested this dozens of times with many different settings and even exchanged it to no avail. Considering this is arguably the most important factor in a connection (fyi, this is what actually makes your internet feel fast) it's astounding that tplink was able to mess it up this badly. I can't imagine it would be any better in a more demanding situation.<br /><br />Update - They still haven't fixed the latency issue even with the latest available update. You don't really notice it just browsing but it does become an issue during time sensitive things like gaming/voip. Tplink, what have you been doing for the past year??<br /><br />- Software is buggy and inefficient. Plus the layout is all over the place - while the layout is still better than ubiquiti unifi, the usually straightforward tplink layout is going. Not a big deal since you mostly just set it and forget it, but still...<br /><br />Update - DO NOT USE THE EAP Controller utility! While the layout is significantly better than it was, it's severely crippled - you can't even change basic settings such as Tx power. Instead, I recommend using the EAP Discovery utility to find the IP address that was assigned to the AP by the dhcp server(your router) and configuring it through the web ui. If you have so many access points that you need a centralized utility to manage them, then you shouldn't be using these APs in the first place...<br /><br />- Latest USA firmware version 151022 or newer is locked. Cannot be downgraded at all and can only be upgraded with firmware from the tplink usa site. The tplink GLOBAL site always has newer firmware with the latest fixes so it's too bad you can't use those.<br /><br />Update - Firmware update still locks you to a country, but they released the same firmware across all countries with the only significant difference being max Tx power. I suggest going with the US version as it has a max Tx of 26dBm vs only 20 on the EU version. You can always lower it in the web ui if you need to.<br /><br />- The country cannot be changed on firmware 151022 or newer in the web ui. If you try to change it in the controller software, it will crash and you have to hard reset it.<br /><br />Update - Fixed - they just removed the option.<br /><br />- Does not use standard 802.3af poe so you must use the included injector. This is expected at this price point but it's something to keep in mind when installing. If you want to use a standard poe switch, you have to spring for the eap120 or higher.<br /><br />The Ugly Conclusion:<br />Since we exclusively use tplink business class switches(which work flawlessly), we had high exceptions for their first business class indoor access point... On paper it appears to be equal to or better than any of its competitors, and in some ways it is. Unfortunately, it looks like tplink rushed it too quickly to market because it has some significant shortcomings. While the wonky software and not being able to change the firmware or country is annoying, the high latency is a HUGE deal breaker. Until tplink fixes it(may take a long time, if ever) I cannot recommend it.<br /><br />Update - I still stand by my original conclusion. While the complete overhaul of the UI makes it nicer to look at and maybe a little easier to configure, it wasn't the priority. They should have used those resources to fix lingering bugs and make the underlying firmware more efficient/streamlined(which would hopefully fix the latency issue and anything else that could potentially affect stability). Maybe in the next update...next year...<br /><br />Side note - For 5 months I was using Unifi UAP access points. They seemed perfect at first - they are also cheap and seemingly well made with a very active forum and timely firmware updates...and their marketing department is excellent. The very active forum is because of all the problems people have(especially with apple products) and the timely updates(which are sometimes completely unusable) are the patches to fix all the problems - it's like being part of a never-ending beta. I switched back to the EAP as my main AP - which for the past couple months has been stable. If you're reading this review deciding on a $50 &#34;enterprise&#34; grade access point, I strongly recommend against Unifi if stability is a priority.",neutral,positive

"I used this for a large video project this summer.  It did the job well enough, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is looking for decent DSLR HD video audio capture.  Why?  Because it is not bus-powered.  You need to be sure this is powered on and the 9V battery is always good to go.<br /><br />I used this in 2 different situations:<br /><br />1) in camera audio capture, connected directly to D7000, 7D & 5DII bodies.  It produced great audio, but many times I forgot to turn the mic on, which resulted in zero sound.<br />2) I used this in conjunction with an external audio device, such as the Zoom H1, to get more specifically located audio.  Again, it did the job good enough.<br /><br />But compared to the Nikon ME-1, you're missing a lot of handy features from the VideoMic.  For example:<br /><br />Nikon ME-1 is stereo.  VideoMic is mono.<br />Nikon ME-1 is bus-powered.  VideoMic requires on switch and 9V battery.<br />Nikon ME-1 is compact and small.  VideoMic is large and bulky.<br />Nikon ME-1 is cheaper than the VideoMic.<br /><br />After using both of them I sold my VideMic promptly.  The Nikon ME-1 does the job much better.<br /><br />Finally the included Fuzzy Windjammer on this kit doesn't do much more than the already included foam on the VideoMic.  I compared the two in light wind situations and found the sound to be nearly the same.<br /><br />Save some money and trouble, get the Nikon ME-1.<br /><br />Ben",neutral,positive

"I use this with my iPad2 and the Foreflight app in my Cessna 210.  It works great.  I like being able to have an app that separately tracks the status of the GPS--battery function, how many satellites it is tracking, etc.  It stays put on the dash and seems to operate OK even when it gets hot in the sunlight.  It seems to have a battery life between charges that exceeds the iPad's battery, although I have not pushed it more than 5 hours.<br /><br />I chose this over the Bad Elf GPS because I borrowed a friend's Bad Elf and it kept falling out of the slot and nearly became lost three times in one trip.  Plus you can position this closer to a window in order to get better reception.<br /><br />Sitting in a commercial airline cabin near the window, this unit acquired satellites and tracked the flight, where the internal GPS in my iPad failed to acquire satellites.  So this is definitely a step up from the interal GPS in an iPad.",positive,positive

"There are a couple other reviews which really provide some great technical details about these cameras. One guy in particular has even created a set of instructions you can print. I'm just going to provide a real short summary.<br /><br />I spent hours looking into dash cams. I already have a GoPro, but wanted something that would auto-record with looping capability. In all of my research, I never did find the ""perfect"" camera. But the Black Box cameras are close.<br /><br />Whether you'll like this camera or not will likely come from what you're planning on using it for. I wanted front and rear car cameras to catch police misconduct and possible insurance scams or accidents. I bought two of them, and mounted them front and back. If you're looking to use this camera for something else, your results my vary.<br /><br />I joke in the title of my review because I've heard and read that-- per capital-- Russians use more dash cams than any other drivers mainly because of corrupt cops. Well, these Black Box cameras are clearly aimed at that market. They are designed from the ground up to be dash cams activated when you start your car, and to turn off when you stop your car (or when motion stops).<br /><br />The funny thing is that whoever is making these cameras does not wish to stand behind their product enough to offer a warranty or even a name for their company. It's like these were engineered in Hong Kong or China by a real no-name outfit. Almost like they're made anonymously. It's a shame because I think with a few minor design changes, these cameras could be something for a company to be proud of.<br /><br />These cameras are cheap and quirky, but they do work. They feel cheap, the software is a bit rough around the edges, and I'll bet the location where the windshield mount attaches to the camera will be the first part to break. The LED on one of my cameras glowed with a different color than the other when it would switch from blue to red (further evidence these things are really thrown together). Navigating around the functions of the camera is also a bit strange, but you get the hang of it pretty quick.<br /><br />I found the motion detection to be useless. It doesn't detect only small bits of motion, but only large movement. So, the camera would stop recording at stop lights and stop signs, only to resume when I really got moving. I turned the setting off so that the recording would be comprehensive. I can imagine that this setting my be helpful if you want to catch someone messing with your car minutes after you park and shut the car off, but otherwise it doesn't seem that handy of a feature.<br /><br />I also turned off the G-sensor setting because I don't understand it. If I'm always recording, I'm not sure what this sensor would do that's helpful. A review of any video footage should show an accident, and ""locking"" a video clip seems unnecessarily because I wouldn't delete any videos after an accident unless and until I reviewed them all and saved the important ones.<br /><br />Overall, the cameras do work. The video quality is excellent, and they turn on and off just when I want (they start recording when I start my car, and stop when I turn it off). Once you get them 12-volt power, they are automatic (you don't need to push any buttons or fiddle with them at all). You can record everything, all the time, and shut off the audio record feature for privacy (so you don't get lots of recordings of singing or talking on the phone) and also to comply with local laws that might require notification to others when you're recording.<br /><br />Every American should have at least one in their car to document police encounters. For the price, get two and document both front and rear. If it saves you from one ticket, you will have easily paid for two of these cameras.<br /><br />UPDATE: After two months of use, one of the USB female ports broke from the plastic frame and off of the circuit board when the USB charging cable was pulled too hard. To some extent, the force of the pull to the cable was strong so I can't blame the camera entirely, but the brittle cheap plastic of the camera surely didn't help. Also, on both cameras the plastic locking tabs on top of the cameras (that secure them to the windshield mounts) both snapped off, making the cameras less secure in their mounting. I've reduced the rating from four stars to three. These cameras are still a good value, but the plastic used to make them is crap.",neutral,positive

"Well this was a replacement television for a previously owned LG 42 inch tv that started having intermittent on and off problems.  This TV is VERY SHARP.  So much so, that in some cases it distorts the picture of faces to some degree.  So far, I only find this with commercials so I don't care.  Nice picture quality.  I didn't even adjust out of the box, just left it the way it was factory set.  Purchased a Warranty because nowadays these t.v.'s don't last that long.  This is in my bedroom, so the fact that the sound is not that great is alright by me.  I wouldn't recommend it for any other room in the home unless you enhance the sound.  Otherwise, a decent purchase for what I paid here on Amazon.  Couldn't find a price anywhere better.",neutral,negative

Oh yeah, and closing the app does not necessarily close your data stream.  Make sure you go and kill the app or else it will eat up your data.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I don't like the idea of having to connect to a cloud to find out where my DVR is, and then getting rerouted to my DVR.

"The good: The extender actually is far more feature-rich and configurable than the specifications show. Once you get into the advanced configuration options, you can configure as many (or in some cases) more parameters than your average WiFi router. You can also use it as a wired-to-wireless gateway, which is my configuration.<br /><br />The bad: The web interface is a train wreck — terribly designed and hard to navigate. Settings are hard to find, and sometimes in the middle of configuring something the device will stop responding, and you’ll have to completely reset it (using the hardware reset button — hold it down for 8 seconds) and start configuration from scratch. It took me two hours to get it how I wanted it, but only 10 minutes of that is actual configuration — the rest is try, reset, start again.<br /><br />The ugly: Requires at least one reboot every couple days. And there is no setting to automatically reboot. Sometimes it requires REPEATED REBOOTS in sequence before it starts functioning again. I would not have believed it had I not seen it myself!",neutral,negative

"UPDATE: They have finally reached their limit. After about a year and a half they have broken, they will not stay connected to my phone or even stay on. I guess you get what you pay for with these.<br /><br />I used to bye $10 earbuds from amazon but I kept losing my iPhone dongle (which is also $10) so I decide to get wireless headphones. I also needed something better for an active life (not always worrying about a wire when working out).<br />I've had these headphones for about a year and I've used them at the gym, on the plane, in my room, etc. The sound quality isn't anything terrible, I don't find my music to be dull or empty but not 100% like Bose headphone quality (expected). I'm able to run/lift/bike and have no problems with them staying in. Sometimes when I leave my phone to grab more weights the sound starts to break up but the range isn't terrible, almost helps me remember to take my phone with me when I leave an area.<br />Battery life is good and charging is really easy.

"Amazon can be so hit or miss with products from various sellers. When I saw this bag I was skeptical about the leather truly being full grain, but the many glowing reviews and photos made me take a chance on this bag. I’m so glad I went with my gut here because this bag is incredible. The leather is thick and luxurious to the touch. It smells amazing and the pull up is so cool. I also love all the little scratches full grain leather gets. Makes it look rugged and that’s exactly what I wanted. The entire bag is padded inside to protect your camera and other belongings. It also has two inner dividers that velcro where you want them. There are two inside pockets, two smaller pockets just under the front flap, and one pocket on the outer back of the bag. There are also pockets on each side beneath the strap clips. Right now I only have my camera and strap inside, but it has a nice amount of space for extra stuff like lenses, batteries, an iPad mini and/or kindle, etc. As I mentioned before the leather is really thick so it’s fairly firm right now, but with use full grain leather becomes more pliable and patinas too so it’ll keep changing with time. I’m so happy with this purchase and am going to tell everyone about this bag. Excellent value for superior craftsmanship. Also the included note is a nice touch.",positive,positive

Also, though Spot is centrally located in the middle of our open concept living area, too often the Dots two rooms away respond to my voice. I find I have to be almost facing the front of the Spot to get it to respond, and also that’s the only location where you can see the blue ring to know Spot heard you.

So...one day I decided to pop out the little ledge for some weird reason & saw that it had mold in it because it almost always stays a little bit wet.<br /><br />No biggie now that I know, I just take it off often and bleach it to be sure it stays clean, which is super easy...but it was kind of gross to see that I'd been bathing my baby boy in it with mold inside.

"I've had a number of digital cameras over the years, but this was my first nikon purchase. I purchased at Target on Black Friday and definitely regret the waste of my time waiting in line to get such a poor camera. I liked the size, the color and the price and that it had a rechargeable battery. This purchase was a gift for my 11 year old daughter. I made sure to get a case for it right away. Well, inside the case, the darned LCD cracked, rendering the camera useless. First, you discover that unlike most digital cameras, the lcd is exposed, as opposed to being covered with a hard plastic covering. Then you do some research and figure that maybe you can replace the screen yourself for about 20 bucks, but WAIT, there is nothing for this model. Oh, and I forgot to include that when I went to register this camera, it's listed as a gray market camera, which means Nikon doesn't honor the warranty on it. I think this is highly unacceptable.

"Fine Uniden Voyager Handheld in my opinion for two and a half years (up to now), but over the winter when stored in my house (charged, but not continuously charging) when I went to take it off the shelf and to the boat, I noted the radio was somewhat tilted out of its charger.

"Hello fellow AD 282 or A261 buyers....  can anyone explain the Auto Power Off Setting.  I have inquired to Both sellers.. VIPUnion & Vonhome.  One says when the power (car adapter) is removed the unit will now run on the battery for either 1 min, 3 min or 5 min... if selected in the Auto power off setting... or it will shut down in 15 seconds if &#34;off&#34; is selected.  I have chosen 1 minute and the unit always still shuts down in 15 seconds.  This is the same regardless if I choose 3 min, 5 min or the off selection.  It always will continue to record on the battery for only 15 seconds and shut down.  I was told to fully charge the unit and do a reset.........STILL there is no difference.  The other seller insists the Auto power off setting has nothing to do with running the unit on the battery after the power is removed.  Instead they insist that when you choose to record manually (on the battery)  the unit will record for only 1 , 3 , or 5 minutes and then shut down......and if &#34;off&#34; is selected it will continue to record until the battery is depleted... 20-30 min.  THIS information (explanation) is also INCORRECT.  When recording on the battery... (to be clear... no car charger)  the unit will record indefinitely until the battery is depleted.......DESPITE  1min , 3 min , or 5 minutes selected in the Auto Power off setting.

There are many interesting ways to accommodate individual hearing profiles: software, equalizers, etc. The audiophile community is full of headphone descriptions promoting a particular frequency pattern, so Nura's attempt using AI and an interactive experience was promising.<br />None of this matters if you can't use the headphones.<br />I don't think my ears are terribly sensitive, but these things really hurt. I don't think I could use them for more than a half hour at a time and it just didn't really get any better. So 3 stars here, but not one or two, because the concepts sort of works, but it's clunky.<br />I set it up on an Android phone. That was all fine, though it's a little fussy to get the right seal.The phone software is fine and clean, but it's on the phone, so you can't fiddle with it if you are pairing with a computer - you have to go back to the phone to jiggle things.<br />As for the sound, it isn't bad, but I don't think it's worth the price. My guess is that many folks who would buy this already have good headphones and likely better cans that this in the 300 dollar range. While these were better than many, they lacked clarity, felt muddy and slow, even with the bass adjusted. But you can't jiggle the profile unless you equalize. So now you've got Nura and EQ between you and the music. I think better to find headphones that please you with a minimum of interference. (I do occasionally use &#34;TrueFi&#34; an interesting software that tries to correct for your age.)<br />So while I think it's an upgrade from cheap headphones, it's not 3-400$ of goodness, for me anyway. And if you can't wear it, it doesn't matter how good it is.",neutral,positive
The polarity (red and white) is reversed.  The 3.5mm plug makes poor contact so that my right speaker occasionally cuts out.  Had to run behind my computer to jiggle it to get the sound back.  Will buy something else.,negative,negative

"After using this MP3 player for about a week, it froze up.  I couldn't turn it off or change the function.  It froze while in the Bluetooth function.  So, it sat on my desk for about 8 hours - still on and still frozen.  Not sure what was going on but the battery discharged significantly in that amount of time and when I attempted to change the function again it failed to do so.  The player did, however, turn off when I pressed the button that time.  The next day I tried to use it again but it needed to be recharged  again.  The next time I used it, it operated as it should have all along.  (Fingers crossed)<br /><br />I had to play around with it quite a bit to figure out how to find my music because the functions are not intuitive.  The sound from this player is adequate but nothing special.  You definitely should have a decent speaker system or headphones to enjoy your music properly from this player.  All said, it gets the job done.  Thus 3 stars.",neutral,negative

"I’ve never cared for the ear buds that use a rubber end that stick in to your ears. One of my airpods stopped working recently and I didn’t want to spend the money on another pair so I thought I’d give these a try. I know skullcandy is a trusted brand so despite the 4 star review I thought they would be a solid choice.<br /><br />Pros: They sound okay. Not the best sound quality but for $30 it’s decent. I don’t think they actually cancel background noise so much as the rubber end just plugs your ears. Also the battery life seems to last a decent time.<br /><br />Cons: They are uncomfortable. I don’t know if I just have a weird ear shape or what but buds with rubber tips don’t seem to ever work for me. I tried all three sizes of tips that were included but they were all uncomfortable. It’s like if you put them in all the way your ear gets plugged completely, you feel the pressure and the sound is quiet and nasaly. If you don’t put them all the way in it’s easier to hear the music but the bass does not come through as well and they are not secure.<br /><br />Summary: for $30, not bad if you like this type of ear bud. Personally I don’t think they will work for me, I will probably shop around and try a pair that is more shaped like the traditional first and second generation apple airpods.",neutral,positive

"I've been working on building a Threadripper system using this motherboard and I did not purchase it from Amazon but I purchased them from MicroCenter. The reason I bought from MicroCenter was for ease of returning if there was an issue. Good thing I did because I have already replaced one Motherboard and I'm about to return my second motherboard. I am going to try one more motherboard to see if I can get to work. The main issue that I've been having is that I cannot get the board to boot with all eight memory slots filled. This motherboard is supposed to be able to take up to 128 GB of RAM, and I have only been able to max out at 64 GB.<br /><br />All of the RAM that I've been using has been on the quality memory list provided by ASUS. I've also purchased two different packs of 128 GB of Crucial Dominator RAM off of Amazon to try in the two various boards that I have had and both of those two boxes, one was DDR4 – 2666 and the other one was DDR4 – 2400. Whenever I inserted all of the sticks of RAM, I got three beep codes. If you install the RAM per the instructions in the manual, I will get 3 Beep codes after installing more than two sticks. I found on the Internet a suggestion to install the RAM from right to left which I did, and I was able to get six sticks to work but not the final two memory slots which I believe or D1 and D2. Any time memory was inserted into those Slots the motherboard would not boot, and I would get the three beep codes.<br /><br />I contacted Asus tech support and they have been of little help. I've sent them tweets and they've gotten back to me quickly but after I sent them the information I haven't heard anything again. The people over MicroCenter are accommodating that's why I continue to purchase products from them as well as having the option of returning if there's an issue.<br /><br />I'm going to give one more brand-new board a shot with a whole new set of RAM. I was trying crucial dominator ram which did work but only in the minimal slot configurations. I do not believe this was a RAM issue and I'm pretty sure that it is a motherboard issue.<br /><br />I do love Asus products, and I understand this is new technology, but I shouldn't have these kinds of issues with such a high priced motherboard. I would also think that I would be able to get better technical support through Asus and I would think that they would care about one of their customers who has had such difficulty getting one of their flagship products to work multiple times. If anything changes I will post an update to this review. I hope to get a new board up and running this weekend with all DIMM slots filled.",neutral,positive

"This is my first diffuser I have purchased for use with essential oils.

"This is a VERY cheap wireless keyboard/mouse combo that is about worth what you pay for it. Honestly, for $15 what are you expecting? To say that these are NOT for gaming is a gross understatement. These really aren't even good enough for regular, daily use. I would put them in the category of an emergency back-up device, only to use if absolutely necessary.<br /><br />The keyboard action is horrible and would be a pain to work with on any type of regular basis. I've seen better built keyboards for sale at Dollar Tree, although none of those were wireless. The mouse is made of the cheapest, thinnest plastic I have ever seen for a consumer electronics device. It is so lightweight that without batteries inserted it practically has no weight at all. Again, it isn't something that you would want to use with any regularity.<br /><br />This is definitely a case where you get what you pay for, which is why I am being somewhat generous by giving the product three stars.",neutral,negative

"I got this to replace an old Polar Heart rate mon.<br />POLAR was much more dependable for heart rate.  This thing tended to lose the signal.  The heart rate would read steadily for a while and then start jumping around.  Since the EMTs never had to scrape me off the ground, I'm going to say the monitor was off (by 50 bps).<br /><br />My unit came with the pedometer accessory and the battery was dead in that, so maybe it's nearly dead in the heart rate strap and that's the problem? Very frustrating to try to ""mate"" the watch to the sensors when the batteries are weak or dead.<br /><br />It's easy to get lost in the maze of ""Views"" and ""Modes"".  Since a lot of them just display zeroes it's difficult to know what mode or view you're in just at a glance (and who wants to stop?).<br />True, most of the time you will leave it on one view for one exercise, but what if you'd like to know your speed and heart rate?  So far as I can tell, that doesn't show on any single screen.<br />Which sucks.<br /><br />Maybe if the thing worked out of the box I would have been more tolerant of the scattershot instruction manual and not so friendly display.<br /><br />On the plus side: IF you need the multi-sport, multi-sensor features, it's cheap.  If you really just want a heart monitor or a pedometer or a bicycle cadence/speed display, you can do a lot better for less money.",negative,negative

"If you want the trackball for gaming or general PC getting around. The choices I see, are getting worse. I first got hooked on the wired Logitech Marble. Loved and still own a few. Now, I needed a wireless option and tried one from Logitech and a few other brands. Just have trouble getting used to the side marble and it wasn't great for gaming and the others were cheap and felt low quality.<br /><br />Brings us to the Kensington Orbit. For me, it is as close to the Marble as I have found so far in a wireless version. Good range and plenty response options. Ball is in the center where I prefer to have it. 2 buttons the way a mouse was meant to be (although a couple tiny programable buttons would be nice at this price). Yet not all is perfect, but I am coping with it. The tricky bit for me that hinders a higher rating. First, the right click button is too big. There is no where for my pinky finger to rest without clicking. Please revise the design just a bit for the base to ride a bit higher or the button to get a bit smaller. Or add a flip up piece to partially cover the button to prevent pushing it (likely to 3D print something for my use). Who needs the right click button to be so prominent. Secondly, It might be me, but the sliders/scroll on either side of the ball are not great. They hesitate and don't react to my touch too well, but it might be me with rough fingers.<br /><br />I will keep the mouse because it works well for what I need right now. But, Hey Kensington, consider a revised model that has room for the finger to rest somewhere on the right that does no result in a button press. Can't be the only one.

"First, the cabinet arrived dented and the box with holes in it due to being shipped with no padding whatsoever. There was no documentation inside and parts were loosely strewn all over the inside. Due to all of the nooks and crannies inside it took a few days before I was even able to find the keys, which were stuck in between pieces of sheet metal.<br /><br />Once I got the parts sorted out, setting the cabinet up was pretty straight forward. Fortunately, I have worked with plenty of 19"" rack mount cabinets before, so I didn't need any instructions, as if there were any.<br /><br />There are a number of break off tabs on the back and bottom to run cables through, depending upon how you want to mount it. There are also mounting holes to allow you to mount the cabinet directly on to a wall. I just have mine sitting upright on a desk though.<br /><br />The material that the rack is made of is quite thin compared to any other cabinet I have worked on before. I'm guessing that this is done to not only keep manufacturing costs low but reduce shipping charges as well. The metal is thick enough for light business use, but it definitely is not up to specs for industrial, military or critical infrastructure use though.<br /><br />The cabinet has side panels that allow you to access your gear from the left or right sides. To install equipment you need to access through the front of the cabinet though, which has a tinted glass door. I'm rather shocked that the glass door survived the shipping process, honestly, as the outside was pretty badly dented.<br /><br />One nice feature that this cabinet has is that the entire rack slides forward, so that you can move everything at once out the front. This part is pretty well thought out and engineered. There are both bottom and top openings which allow you to mount fan(s) so that air will circulate from top to bottom, or vice versa. There are lots of gaps and holes in the cabinet, so air flow is nowhere near optimal, unfortunately.<br /><br />I've initially installed a rack mount power strip, a power conditioner, a gigabyte Ethernet switch and a 2U server. There is plenty of room left over. Altogether, it's a perfectly nice cabinet for my own purposes at home. It really is not up to snuff in terms of build quality for mission critical IT use though. I am used to working with racks that weigh hundreds of pounds and that if dropped on the sidewalk would leave the concrete more damaged than the cabinet itself. The fact that the cabinet arrived dented after being sent through the Post Office is proof enough that it needs to be constructed much more robustly.<br /><br />UPDATE: Since the first one that I received was dented, I ended up getting a replacement from Amazon, albeit it this is a slightly different model. It's still 9U. It still has the glass front panel. However, the side panels are held in place by a large outward latch rather than a small, recessed one. It's also several inches deeper but not as wide as the previous one. They did a SLIGHTLY better job packing it this time and no damage is immediately apparent. It does have the same problem with the parts being strewn all over the inside of the case though. Someone at QA has really fallen asleep at the switch on this product. It is so badly packed that it is a miracle that the thing arrived in one piece. Quite literally THE worst job of packing an electronics item that I have ever seen in my life. BTW, like the last one, this one arrived with no documentation of any kind. No warranty. Nothing. Just a bunch of loose parts inside.",neutral,positive

"This cost $69, and was a good buy at that price.<br /><br />The metal frame around the translucent center diffuser piece, is a thick sturdy springy metal band (not the thinner round metal bands found in car windshield shade/sun-protectors).  This makes the unit very stiff and the material very smooth; and gives a nice place to grip onto a clamp with the included stand. However, it does make it rather hard to fold back up with this heavy duty spring metal band.<br /><br />It comes in a nice round carry bag.  The black material of the bag is rather thin, and not padded, but sufficient for carry and storage if you are gentle.<br /><br />The reflector bag/pocket (with the black/white/gold/silver material) seems very sturdy, and has 2 zippers that go all the way around (you can unzip only the top half, and slide the stiff translucent section in/out to turn in-side out to reverse the colors.  It is a very tight fit (Good, since it keeps the material stretched tight;  and bad, since it makes it hard to close the zippers).  The white is a pure clean bright white, the black is a very dark pure black (just as you would want it to be), neither are very shinny (closer to dull matte surface).  The Silver and Gold sides are very shinny, and rather smooth when stretched tight.  The Gold is more of an orange Gold, rather than a yellow gold (I added a light coat of white spray paint to the gold to reduce the orange tint it gives to skin tone).  The silver ends up with small wrinkles, which focus or diffuse the light to give brighter or darker spots if your are very close to the reflector (sort of like water movement on a pool surface), not so noticeable if your are far from the reflector.  The materials are not thick enough for every day use in a professional studio, but should last a very long time for occasional use by a hobbyist (if you don't abuse them).<br /><br />It takes a long time (many minutes), to unzip the bags, take out diffuser, turn bags inside out, re-zip bags. So I would only suggest this 5-in-1 for occasional use for those on a budget, (If you need to go back and forth quickly between the 5 material, best to get dedicated reflectors for each color.  The internal diffuser on the metal frame has a large cloth loop/handle, for hanging this if you don't want to use the included stand, (when you put the diffuser into the black&white&silver&gold bag, make sure the hole in the bag lines up with the cloth handle, so you can also hang the bag from hooks/branches....)<br /><br />The metal stand has a wide base (I don't need to use sand bags to avoid tipping, unless I'm outside on a windy day, in which case I'd also need extra clamps to hold the reflector to the stand). The stand has a single spring loaded clamp that is custom made for this reflector and grabs around the thick metal band; (The reflector hangs from this clamp by gravity, so you are limited to how you can point/direct the light).  Note that the reviews for this product seem to contain a mix of Stand only, and Stand with Arm.  My review is for Stand only (without the arm).  My stand is plenty strong, and the clip works nicely, (reviewers that bought the arm with the stand seem to be less happy with the arm).<br /><br />Over-all, I'm very happy with this purchase, and would buy this again if I needed another one.",positive,positive

"How does it work? That's the one thing I wanted to know. Let me answer that for you.<br /><br />This is a ball point pen that requires two other things to function as a complete system. You will also need a special notebook. One comes with the pen, along with a nice leather or leather-like case. You can also purchase more. The notebooks have paper with a very fine mesh of dots. I'll get back to this later. The third thing you will need is a later model iPhone or iPad with the Livescribe+ (plus) app.<br /><br />The (extremely) fine dot mesh on the paper of the notebook somehow lets the app know where your pen is or has been on the paper. I have no idea exactly how it works, but that's the only thing that makes sense. There are areas on the paper that function as buttons. When touched by the pen, something happens. You can guess what the button does by the icon that represents it. One such set of buttons appears on every set of pages. A set of pages consists of the page on the left and right when you have the notebook open at any location. This set of buttons I'm talking about is for recording. One starts, one pauses, and one button stops recording. So, you can control the app by touching various ""buttons"" on the paper.<br /><br />With the app open and the pen paired via Bluetooth, when you write on the notebook, whatever you write is copied into the app. There is a slight delay, but it is more or less in real-time. It doesn't matter what you write or draw, it is captured (presumably by the dot mesh) and copied into the app. You can also take an audio recording while you are writing and the app will associate it with what you are writing. Let's say you are attending a lecture. You write down the contact information as the lecturer provides it, but you don't need audio of it. But then the lecturer starts to explain something that you want to record. You touch the record ""button"" and your iPhone or iPad will start to record as you write or draw. Anything that you write or draw during recording is linked to the recording. In the app, if something has audio associated with it, it is highlighted in green. This allows selective playback.<br /><br />The app will allow you to send (email, etc.) or print your notes. I easily sent a page to myself via email. The page came as an attachment. I don't know if you can send more than a page, but I can't imagine wanting to do that anyway. However, if you want to ""draw a picture"" for someone with whom you are talking on the phone, it is a lot easier to use the Livescribe than to draw a picture on paper, photograph it, and then send it. Speaking only for myself, this feature seems more novel than practical.<br /><br />Another important feature of the app is that it will show you everything you put to paper, in the order that you created it. This comes in handy if you like to conserve paper and tend to go back to fill in empty space, or if you run out of space and continue somewhere else. The normal way of making sense of that is to draw an arrow from the point you left off to the point where you started writing again. With the app, you don't have to do that. Although I'll admit, I'd draw those arrows anyway. Still, this feature is good for someone who scribbles randomly and needs to study things in order later on.<br /><br />By the way, I wanted to know if what you write will still be recorded to the app if you don't have your iPhone or iPad handy. I wrote some lines and then synced with the app. The lines appeared in the app. That tells me that the notebook (dots) ""tell"" the pen where it has been writing and the pen stores it until it can transmit it to the app. I don't know how much memory the pen has, so to be safe, I'd have my iPhone and iPad running. Besides, you can't audio record if the iPhone or iPad isn't running and synced.<br /><br />Those are the major points. Features that I didn't cover, I consider minor.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because there are sometimes glitches. For me, during my test period, the pen unlinked itself to the app for no reason. I also saw videos of people demonstrating it who ran into similar problems. They weren't show stoppers, but if it happens often, I imagine that it would be pretty annoying.<br /><br />To summarize, it works pretty well and there is nothing quite like it.",positive,positive

"Solid device with mountability. The lock-down screw has a bit too much travel and can be annoying to tighten correctly. The hole at the 2280 position actually pierces the top edge of the PCB in my unit leading me to wonder about long term durability. The mounting rails are only connected in one place, making them wobbly.<br /><br />As with many of these types of devices for mSATA and M.2 it puts the drive on the bottom side of the PCB when mounted in a standard laptop or enclosure. THIS IS INCREDIBLY STUPID. With most drives inserted the combination will have to be wedged in to place putting stress on the connector and the top of the M.2 device. I've never had this not work out, but it's simply the wrong way to do it and mechanically forcing things shouldn't be standard operating procedure. As said though, this seems to be par for the course, not just a weakness of this model.<br /><br />Electronically I experienced no issues when testing a Transcend MTS400 2240 sized device.",neutral,negative

"This review is for the version WITHOUT live traffic.<br /><br />I bought this unit for my wife, who has no sense of direction whatsoever. After looking at online text and YouTube video reviews, it seemed as though the TomTom software was simpler than Garmin, and the price was right.<br /><br />After some use, here are my perceptions.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />1. The software is simpler and the menus more sensibly arranged than Garmin. Overall the design is much more intuitive.<br />2. The verbal cues for directions are more descriptive and intuitive than Garmin.<br />3. The unit picks up satellites very quickly, and the unit is sensitive. Once it fell off the window, and continued to give directions from under the seat!<br />4. Screen updates are fast.<br />5. Updating the firmware and maps is very slow (~2 hrs - must be their servers, since my connection is 50Mbps), but the process is simple and straightforward.<br /><br />The not so good:<br /><br />1. The unit does not run very long on a charge. Seemingly about 1.5 hours.<br />2. The mount is a mixed bag. The design is compact, and it's easy to attach to the window, but the swivel ball is VERY stiff. If you try to reorient the unit relative to the window most of the time the swivel ring pops off rather than having the mount pivot.<br />3. The screen contrast could be better.<br /><br />I don't care a lot about POIs and other add-on features. I just want a unit to get from point A to point B.<br /><br />Before driving home from work one day I received an email alert (on my phone) about a traffic jam. After asking for an alternate route, the TomTom gave one that I have found to be very good, except for the final leg where getting on the Mass Pike saves a lot of time (based on prior experience) and avoids stopping at traffic lights. I following the suggested route until the highway on-ramp. Unbelievably, as we entered the ramp the unit re-planned and suggested we go IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, away from our destination. That would have added about 15 miles to the route (into rush hour traffic, no less), and would have put us back essentially where we started.<br /><br />I was stunned. Do I really trust the TomTom for someone who doesn't know East from West? I'm hoping this was some kind of glitch related to the IQ Route software. Perhaps it somehow got confused as to which way rush hour traffic was going (the way we went is bumper-to-bumper in the morning, but this was evening and the highway was clear), and assumed we should go all the way around. Or perhaps the distribution of traffic on this particular stretch of road is extreme and caused their estimation method to go haywire.<br /><br />I have disabled IQ Route, and will update this review when I learn more. Hopefully the TomTom will not display any more crazy lapses in sanity.",positive,positive

Not sure if the microUSB connector on the Raspberry Pi sits too far back on the Pi board or the hole though the case should be enlarged.

"The Kroo iPad case should only be considered if you're desparate for an easel case. Although it's construction is adequate, the iPad has to be taken out and then the case turned inside-out and backwords to function as an easel. When you open the case for the first time, you're greeted with fishnet pockets and cheap-feeling elastic with velcro straps that secure the front and back of the clamshell when it is in easel mode. Trying to figure out which way to use the case took us 20 minutes as there are no instructions. For the price ($16 and change when purchased on Amazon) it offers some protection but I would recommend spending the additional money for something that doesn't require cheesy velcro to hold your unit in place.

I used hers for a few trips and was able to easily put my 19"" HP laptop in it (despite other reviews regarding this), so I felt very comfortable ordering the same pack for my new 16"" laptop, which barely fits in the new backpack.<br /><br />My only guess for this is that NG has outsourced this bag to a different (Chinese) manufacturer, as the color is slightly off and the size is tighter/smaller.  I'm sure, overall, NG is reliable, but who knows how well they're watching the tolerances in the manufacturing process.  In my experience, Chinese manufacturers allow much more tolerance in their process than typical American manufacturers.<br /><br />Nonetheless, it's a great pack, with lots of pockets, rugged integrity, and very comfortable.",neutral,positive

"Although this is an attractive looking Ipad cover; in our family, this makes a great little stand, but I always question the elastic straps that hold the ipad secure.  With much handling, these kind of loose straps loose their elasticity.  Not good.  I like the look of the cover, but this is a light suede feeling, and it does not clean well.  So, be very careful when using it, and snacking with crumbly hands won't help.  This material should be more washable.<br /><br />I like that the cover is less bulky, light to the touch, slip it into tight stops in a bag, or briefcase. However, using the Ipad with the stand,  you cannot feel secure that the stand will not fall.  It is not quite sturdy enough to hold the Ipad with some movement to the screen.  Be careful.  Also, viewing with the stand is only possible with the landscape angle.  Make sure your surfaces are flat and free of objects around it.<br /><br />Laying the ipad cover flat back is another comfortable way to use it. Great to hold on your lap, or in your hand.<br /><br />The Ipad fits comfortably and the inner cover is a suede-like material for protecting the screen.  I appreciate that the corner brackets are not plastic.  There is more rubber to prevent breakage.  Rubber is much needed.<br /><br />This is a 3rd cover I have, and my drawback is the material that is not easily cleaned.  I don't like to see stains, and this has the potential for many.  It could be stronger, but I like the lightweight material..... Rizzo",neutral,positive

"There are several reasons why I chose this motherboard, but here is the most compelling: an abundance of RGB headers and customization options. This has 2 of the 3pin 5V Addressable RGB headers, one at the top and one at the bottom. This will work well with most of the addressable RGB fans popular now, each individual LED can be manipulated.  Next to the bottom 5V is a 5pin RGBW header, for strips that have an additional warm white LED. In addition, there is a 12V 4pin RGB header for standard 12V light strips and fans. I don't care for its placement by the PCI express slots, but its hard to argue with more options. I defy you to find a micro ATX board with this many lighting features.<br /><br />Aside from the RGB fun, this is a solid B450 motherboard. I have found the many 4pin PWM fan headers to be well placed and accessible. You could actually run 2 graphics cards in crossfire, not an option on most micro ATX boards. The included M.2 heatsink is robust, also lacking in most micro ATX MB. At this price, this is going to be hard to beat.<br /><br />I paired this with 16GB of Corsair Vengeance memory rated at 3000Mhz. I dropped in an Athlon 200GE processor for testing and was pleased with the results. With the latest F3 BIOS, I was able to unlock the multiplier, then overclock the $55 chip to 3.6Ghz with no additional voltage, and it is rock solid. Unfortunately when I loaded the XMP profile, for the 3000Mhz memory, it will only run at 2666Mhz. This is the Athlon CPU's limitation, as other reviewers have found around the interwebs. With other second gen Ryzen processors I see no reason for memory limitations.<br /><br />It was a tough decision for me, between this and the ASUS tough B450M. Ultimately the better features and customization options won me over. I am now buying a second Aorus board, as I am giving the first one to my Mother.<br /><br />-buzznut",positive,positive

I can't say this is fact because neither Sony nor Netflix will comment.  When you use it to stream Netflix you are only getting HD speeds of around 14 Mbs.  The consensus on the forums is that is because of some deal with Sony and Netflix that your stream is going through Sony relay servers so they can account for usage.  Not directly to Netflix.  I tested using Netflix FAST testing site and I get 60 Mbs from a PC on same router but player test never goes over 14 Mbs and change.<br /> Not a crisis as it only supports HD and that's fast enough for HD.

"This projector replaces an Optoma HD20 that I had for almost two years. It was a great projector except the color wheel had to be replaced right after the warranty expired. My last Optoma projector had the same issue. So I am expecting this one to have the issue as well. However, I had an extended warranty on the HD20. Well right after the color wheel was replaced something else went wrong with the HD20 and this time it wasn't fixable. The extended warranty covered me and i was refunded the purchase price.<br /><br />The HD25e was my replacement. I am now on my second HD25e. The first one had really blurry corners. Although changing the screen size and adjusting the projectors distance and angle did help some, it was still distracting for a $1000 piece of hardware. Amazon did a fantastic job of replacing it with a new one. Thanks Amazon!<br /><br />Well this second one is blurry as well. I called Optoma and basically was told it is not thier top of the line projector and uses cheaper optics which might cause the blurry issues I am having. Really??? So this makes it acceptable? That said, they did say I could send it in for repair if I felt it was not right. Well with a bit of adjusting distance and angles again and although there is some blurriness, it's not near as bad as the first one. To me any blur is unacceptable for a $1000 projector. Sharpness is not what you skimp on.<br /><br />I might be returning this one as well but I fear I will be facing the same issue unless I go with a different brand. I like the features this model has compared to other brands in this price point. I would have to give up features I like to get a sharper over all picture.",neutral,positive
"Arrived and DVD player wouldn't work.  First ""return"" info came with a regular label so I had to pay for shipping.

I mailed it back in the original box, but packed the box tight around the DVD player.<br /><br /> Unit arrived in a self-styled box made by taping 2 medium sized priority mail boxes together in an uneven and odd sized box.

"I purchased this flash for my Canon T2i. It was a good value and I wanted to try out this brand. I own a Canon 540EZ and the TTL is not compatible with the T2i, which is fine as I wanted to learn to control the flash manually. The Canon flash also does not have a sync port.<br /><br />I tested the YN-468 II in low light the AF assist was wonderful. The light emission doesn't seem as powerful as my old Canon 540EZ, but then I can use TTL and a bunch of other features with this flash. It is lighter than my Canon flash, which I feel is an advantage if you're shooting for a long time such as at an event. I plan to collect a bunch of these flashes and the [[ASIN:B00DA8459G Yongnuo YN-568EX II, YN568EX II Flash, High speed, Ultra powerful GN master control, Off camera speedlite for Canon]] so I can light with speedlights exclusively and given the reasonable price I can do it for not much more than one new Canon flash. The saved money will help with the purchase of radio controls. So far I am pleased with this flash and think it's a good value. I will update this review as I use the flash more as I am uncertain about the durabilty of the flash. My old Canon 540EZ is built like a tank and has served me well but the price and features on the YongNuo is a definite plus.",positive,positive

"Outta the box, the duster is unbalanced. The weight is toward the nozzle, and the plastic feels brittle. Not sure how long this duster will last me.<br /><br />In any case, it works very well for what it's made: dusting my desk and other surfaces. The dust clears away far more than using compressed air. There are two settings, low and high. Usually low is enough. However, I can't stand using this for a while because it's sufferingly loud. My cat runs away whenever I turn this on. Honestly, it's almost as loud as my vacuum cleaner. I took it to my office and use it only for about 5 seconds. Also, because it's unbalanced, it becomes very heavy at the top and awkward to move when dusting.",neutral,positive

"It is amazing how I could love and hate something so intensely as I feel for the Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece.<br /><br />First of all, what I love<br />-The sound is fantastic- people hear me no matter where I am very well.<br />-Wind is dulled greatly<br />-Charges up quickly<br />-Comes with carrier case with enough power for one charge<br />-Fits my old Plantronics recharger<br />-Long talk time (about 4-5 hours min with full charge)<br />-Easy to carry<br />-Fits really well- for the first week, if I am lucky<br /><br />Now what I hate<br />-The stupid case demagnetizes credit cards if it gets too close<br />-This ear piece only stays in my ear for the first few days of a new earpiece<br />-Once it is past a few days, this earpiece will NOT stay in my ear no matter WHAT I do<br /><br />Yes, I know I am putting it on my ear correctly- the little U shaped tab goes down the ear canal and then I plug in the center silicone plug area into my ear canal.  Like I said, the first few days of ownership and a new replacement pad, I can wear it for the entire day with no problems.  Then after that, it gets worse so fast that I can not keep it in my ear.<br /><br />I am so upset about this, because I really truly love this earpiece. The sound and clarity is fantastic, but when it pops out of my ear, I not only can not hear, it is dangerous if I am on the road when it happens too.<br /><br />I have tried everything to get this to work in my ear.  After a whole year of owning it, I am going to try elastic and then probably try another one eventually when I can swing it.<br /><br />I can not believe how much I love and hate this thing at the same time!",neutral,positive

"My first tivo mini vox was installed and loaded, right when it got to the tivo screen the display blacked out.  The replacement works as expected.  Note that even though you see Amazon and Plex apps in the listing on Amazon, those apps do not exist and are not available for download.  Configuring the remote for RF required a call to support, a remote reset and a reboot of the mini to work.  Remember, it’s early in the game for this new box, there are a few odd issues still being worked out.  Wonerding if Plex on a Nvidia Shield might be the better way to go, it wouldn’t be integrated with my tivo dvr but it would be more feature rich and provide the same result for just about the same investment.  Tivo support is interesting, clearly outsourced to a call center and the technicians still have undeveloped scripts, when I called they told me to unplug a usb dongle that doesn’t exist, after I encouraged them to go get a Mini Vox and look at it, they came back with proper guidance.",neutral,positive
"Maybe like vinyl cassettes are going to make a comeback, though I don't know why.  The sound quality isn't great and there's all that annoying fast forwarding or rewinding if you want to find something.  Streaming is a lot more convenient.  Anyway, as a piece of nostalgia this is pretty good.  It has all the features of my old Walkman (a real Sony one) and it has a micro USB port so you can power it without alkaline batteries.  That would have been nice in the 90s.<br /><br />The real problem for me was finding a tape for it.  The only one I could find was an old blank one.  I tried to record but it didn't turn out really well.  There was a lot of screeching over the sound of the music, which is probably more because I was using a 15-20-year-old cassette than the device.  The radio works pretty well so even if you don't have a tape there is that.<br /><br />One design flaw is that when you open the tape door you can't just pull it straight out because the lip of the tape door makes it so you sort of have to angle it out.<br /><br />That is all.",neutral,positive
"If you need a 5.1 receiver then this is a really good one to get. It doesn't have WiFi or some other arguably-unnecessary features like the more expensive ones, but since it has Bluetooth connectivity I don't really care that much when anything I want to play can just be played from my phone. As far as connectivity goes you get 4 HDMI ports and 1 HDMI output, but using these ports turns all signals into an HDCP signal and there's no way to turn it off in case you're using some sort of passthrough device that doesn't like HDCP (like I was). I got around this by plugging into my passthrough first and then the receiver but still, wish you could turn HDCP off for devices that don't require it.<br /><br />Either way it's easy to set up, and the speaker connectors won't break easily unless you plug and unplug speakers all the time (just be sure to leave slack for your wires if you ever want to pull the receiver out of wherever you're storing it though). The microphone auto-adjusting feature seems cool but made my rear surround speakers way too loud so I ended up adjusting the speakers manually, which I've always had to do with receivers. I haven't used the radio and doubt I ever will but it comes with an antenna and would also be easy to set up.<br /><br />As far as the sound goes it sounds as good as you'd expect with a ~$200 receiver. Voices are clear and easy to bring to the front in case you can't hear them and everything else goes through very well. I also like how it can detect the name of an input you're using, like Blu-ray or Xbox One, without you having to name the input yourself. It also looks very nice with brushed metal and not a lot of gloss making it easier to keep clean.",positive,positive

"I recently had these RB-61's in the cherry color. They were beautiful to look at and were built solid as a rock. I could not locate a dealer within driving distance and so I bought them site un-seen (Yes, I know. 'Not a smart thing to do). I had them hooked up to a Yamaha RX-797 stereo receiver which has very good specs and is advertised as being made with high-end components. You've probably noticed that I have been speaking in ""past tense"". That's because I sold my RB-61's. Why? To me the highs were harsh. Even after adjusting the tone controls on my receiver I could not find a sweet spot. The speaker cables were of high quality and the polarity was correct. I had the speakers located at the ideal height and tried various locations in my room.  I also tried the RB-61's on my Harman Kardon receiver and had the same negative experience. To me, these speakers were ""tiring"". It got to the point where I didn't want to listen to them. To their credit, the bass and mid-range was very good; smooth, clear and tight. The sound projected well and filled my living room with music.<br />It's my belief that the horn-shaped tweeter housing contributes to the harshness. I gave them plenty of break-in time and finally threw in the towel. If I could, I'd give them 7 stars for their beauty and quality construction.  My ears give them 2 to 3 stars for sound.  Many people think they sound great which just goes to show you that everyone has their own opinion of what they like. I now have a pair of Polk RTI-A3's.

According to the Nixplay rep, they have now updated their software to fix this issue.  Unfortunately, we had already returned the frames, so I cannot test this fix.  However, I am changing my overall rating from 2 to 4 stars, since this ""major oversight"" turned out to be a minor glitch that is supposedly resolved and shouldn't be a problem for others.***<br /><br />Original review continues below.<br />************<br /><br />My wife and I purchased two of the these frames with the intent of keeping one for ourselves and gifting one to my in-laws so that we could share photos of their grandkids with them.  I decided to open ours and set it up first, then set up the in-laws' frame in advance.  I never got to theirs.  I had a relatively poor experience with these due to their limitations, and ended up returning them both.<br /><br />TL;DR VERSION:<br />I uploaded photos from my phone (Google Pixel 4XL) into the Nixplay app, which indicated they were successfully uploaded and showing on the frame, but the actual frame would not show my photos.  Eight (8) days of back-and-forth with customer service to identify this issue.  Turns out, the photos taken from my cell phone were too high of resolution for the frame to display.  Their solution is to use a third-party app to reduce my photo sizes before uploading...adding an annoying step (or steps) every time I want to add photos. Not worth the price tag, in our opinion, so we returned the frames.<br /><br />Unrelated to my issue, but you should also know that for anyone to share photos to your frame, they are required to create a Nixplay account through which they can send the photos.  I.e., they cannot send photos via email without setting up their own account.  This may not be an issue for others, but it is for me, so make your own decision there.<br /><br />FULL VERSION:<br />First, I gave this frame 2 stars instead of just 1 because despite our issues, there are some good things about this frame, that shouldn't be overlooked.  Overall, the hardware is nice.  The frame itself has a very modern, sleek design and seemed to be of good quality.  The pictures, when displayed, were clear.  The motion sense and scheduling features were nice and functioned as-expected as well.  No touch-screen or physical buttons on the device, but a remote control, which has a built-in magnet that will work on the back of the frame (though only in one spot very well), was a nice touch.<br /><br />The app itself was a little less than intuitive, although not bad.  Adding photos was a multi-step process (first add to album, then add album to frame).  I was a little confused at first (in that I wasn't entirely sure if I did it correctly), but figured it out pretty quickly without having to consult the manual.  I suspect most people would be able to handle this similarly.<br /><br />Now, getting into the issues we had, and although it was mainly one thing, I consider it a big oversight on Nixplay's part.<br /><br />There two main ways to upload photos.  For simplicity within this review, I'll refer to these as ""direct upload"" (directly uploading a photo from a phone into the app/frame) and ""cloud sync"" (linking / syncing a cloud service, such as Google Photos, to the app/frame).<br /><br />I really like the cloud sync function.  I used a couple Google Photos albums with our frame and it worked great.  The process to connect my Google Photos albums was quick and easy, and the photos showed up almost immediately.  Assuming the link with other cloud services works as well, this is probably the best feature.<br /><br />Where the cloud sync worked flawlessly, the direct upload from my phone into the Nixplay app turned out to be a terrible experience.  The process to upload a photo from my phone to the app itself was actually relatively quick and easy.  The app indicated that all my photos uploaded from my phone (a Google Pixel 4XL - 12.2 MP camera, 4032x3024 pixel resolution) had successfully uploaded into the app/Nixplay cloud storage, and upon assigning to our frame, also indicated that the photos were showing on the frame.  A look at the frame itself proved otherwise.  No matter what I did, the frame would not show photos that were direct uploaded.<br /><br />I searched through the manual and online to find help for this issue.  After trying/checking a few common errors and coming up short, I reached out to customer service.  For their part, customer service was very friendly and patient.  They also required patience on my part, as it took eight days to resolve the issue, frequently with 1-2 days between our back-and-forth e-mail conversations. It ultimately took customer service requesting my account login credentials to troubleshoot for them to identify the problem: my phone's photos were of too high resolution for the 1200 x 800 pixel display.<br /><br />Now, at first this seems reasonable, but here's the problem: nearly every display (computer screen, phone, tablet, tv, etc.) that I've ever used will automatically resize a photo to fit the display screen, regardless of original size (for example, I often use my 4032x3024 pixel photos as background on my phone and computer screens, both well under that resolution).  This is so common that I, and even Nixplay's own customer service, didn't think about that being an issue throughout over a week of troubleshooting.<br /><br />Once the resolution size issue was identified, Nixplay's solution was to use a third-party app to resize all my photos before uploading to the Nixplay app.<br /><br />The whole intent of this device is to quickly and easily share photos -- to our frame and the one to be gifted to the in-laws -- from our phone's photo album (which these days is the primary camera).  If the frame can't handle standard photos from a cell phone without the need for the user to take the extra step to edit photos every time they want to upload, than what's the point?  To me, this was more cumbersome than it's worth.<br /><br />This issue was by far the most problematic, but an ""honorable mention"" for disappointing limitations is that in order for someone else (family, friend, etc.) to share photos to your frame, that person is first required to create their own Nixplay account, even if they don't have a frame themselves.  They cannot just send an email to your frame (via a personalized, unique email address) without having created their own account.  I assume this also means they can only send the photos by uploading them to their Nixplay account first, via the app or website.  This may not be a problem for some, but to us it was a big annoyance and we would never want to ask all our family members and friends to create an account and/or download an app that they don't use themselves.<br /><br />We ultimately decided to return both the purchased frames in preference for a brand which did not have the limitations of the Nixplay ""Smart"" frame.  For the price of this frame I expected better and am happy with our decision to return these and go with an alternate brand.",positive,positive

"I received a Harmony Touch from Logitech because I own several [[ASIN:B005FO43OU Logitech Harmony One Advanced Universal Remote]] remotes and have recommended them highly. I was looking forward to the Harmony Touch, and I wanted to recommend it just as highly, but unfortunately, I can't. Here are some good things and bad things:<br /><br />Good things:<br /><br />1) The removal of the number buttons to make the Harmony Touch a more convenient size was a good move. The on-screen numbers are easy to find, when they are needed.<br /><br />2) Overall, the size of the Harmony Touch is convenient and comfortable.<br /><br />3) Most of my settings were successfully imported from one of my Harmony One settings, so that saved me some time during set-up.<br /><br />4) Having a dedicated button for the DVR and for the four colored buttons is a great addition.<br /><br />Bad things:<br /><br />1) Unfortunately, there are quite a few things that make the Harmony Touch a bad fit for my living room experience. First, using the whole screen to show just one activity at a time is just stupid, and having to swipe left and right to scroll through the other activities one by one is a significant step backward in terms of usability. I found that extremely annoying. Showing the activities in a list on one, or at most two, screens, as the Harmony One does, provides a far superior user experience.<br /><br />2) Relocating the ""skip forward"" and ""skip backward"" buttons from the remote and putting them on the screen is a huge inconvenience. It baffles me that anyone at Logitech thought that was a good idea. This by itself would be enough for me to eschew the Harmony Touch and stick with the Harmony One.<br /><br />3) The location of the DVR controls (play, stop, fast forward, rewind) to above the screen makes using the Harmony Touch more awkward than using the Harmony One, even though the Harmony One is significantly larger. Using the DVR controls on the [[ASIN:B005FO43OU Logitech Harmony One Advanced Universal Remote]] can be done one-handed. On the Harmony Touch, it requires awkwardly shifting the position of the hand, or using two hands. Another significant step backward in usability.<br /><br />4) The addition of ""favorite channels"" is a needless complication. Every DVR has favorite channel lists built in.<br /><br />Conclusion: in a world where the [[ASIN:B005FO43OU Logitech Harmony One Advanced Universal Remote]] had never been invented, the Harmony Touch would be a terrific addition to any living room. However, the Harmony One does exist, and has existed for years. That being the case, there is really no excuse for the flaws in the design of the Harmony Touch.<br /><br />Suggestions for the Harmony Two, or the Harmony Touch Plus, or whatever the next version will be called:<br /><br />1) Put the most commonly used buttons, including the DVR controls, below the screen, where the user can reach them with one hand. Move the less commonly used buttons (DVR, Guide, Info, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue) above the screen.<br /><br />2) Have physical buttons for ""skip forward"" and ""skip backward"", located beneath the ""fast forward"" and ""rewind"" buttons, as the Harmony One currently does.<br /><br />3) Do not waste the whole screen on one activity label and make users scroll/swipe through screen after screen looking for activities. (Come on, Logitech, that's just stupid.) List them on-screen in a list.<br /><br />4) Use dedicated buttons or touch areas for ""Activities"" and ""Devices"", as the Harmony One currently does (or something similar). Don't play hide-and-seek with two of the most basic functions on the remote.",neutral,positive

"Apple's ""Business"" is apparently to look the other way while its unscrupulous app developers rack up bogus in-app charges on children's games. Apple then takes a 30% cut of all of these bogus charges, giving it little incentive to rein in the practice. The default settings of the iPod allow children to make unlimited in-app purchases with no approval as long as the apple ID was entered within the last 15 minutes. In many of these cases the child is not even made aware that he is doing something that will incur a charge.",negative,positive
"Pros:<br />- okay sound (I got these for exercise, so quality wasn't a priority)<br />- resists sweat<br />- feel sturdy<br />- long battery life<br /><br />Cons:<br />- speaking of long battery life, it completely drains your phone battery. I lose about a percentage/minute when using these things.<br />- cannot skip songs. Usually with blue tooth devices you double tap the main button to skip a song, for some reason these headphones redial the last number you called, leaving you to frantically hang up before the other person answers. After this happens, it locks your phone (at least, it locks an iPhone 6). Locks it like a frozen computer, however the song keeps playing. Rebooting the phone is a work around.<br />- if audio is already playing from your device when you turn these buds on, the stream becomes choppy and unlistenable, even for content local to your device. Rebooting the buds doesn't fix this, rebooting the app doesn't fix this, only restarting your phone, turning on the buds, and then beginning a stream fixes this.<br />- they fall out of your ear. Yes, I know there's different sizes of the robber ear stoppers, but it hardly matters when you're exercising and sweat inevitably drips into your ear canal and lubricates the bud until it falls out. This isn't a product specific defect though, this happens with every pair of buds I use when exercising, however unfortunately Bluetooth ear clasp head phones don't exist, which is why I opted for these. Water/sweat resistant just means the product will not break if it encounters these elements, not that it wicks these elements away.<br /><br />Overall, if you're patient, willing to work around the product's inconveniences, and don't care about audio quality or your phone's battery life, these do the trick. Otherwise, maybe spend an extra $20 on a more quality pair that functions as you'd expect.",negative,negative

So  you haft to hold onto the assemble good or it will come sliding down the tripod when your just trying to tilt your boom arm a little. They should have made it separate. Over all this is a nice boom set up for the price. Just be careful when you are losing or tithing it.

So I did a lot of research on cables, decided HDMI 2.1 would optimize my current needs as well as future proof to some extent.

"The only previous experience I have had with Alexa is on my Kindle, primarily getting weather reports, etc.  It took a bit of time to get it set up but once we got going my family has been enjoying it, and learning new features as we go along.  So far we have been quite pleased with the wide variety of music available for free, and are impressed with the sound quality.  I also made use of Alexa as a timer while I was preparing holiday meals, and just discovered that Alexa can tell me what movies are being shown nearby.<br /><br />It is going to take awhile for me to explore all that Alexa is capable of doing but so far I am quite pleased with how intuitive the commands are and how responsive the programing is.<br /><br />UPDATE:  In the month or so that I have been using this device I continue to be impressed with the great sound this compact unit has.  I can ask Alexa to play a specific genre or artist and she will shuffle through the appropriate selections in her library and then play until told to stop or her program is complete.  I also enjoy getting a customized weather report on command as well as the interesting daily factoid Alexa delivers each morning in response to my greeting.<br /><br />There are a couple of glitches though that have come up.  The first is that Alexa will occasionally announce that she is having trouble with the wifi connection.  Usually she can resolve this herself, but once in awhile the reset button needs to be used which resolves the problem in less than a minute.  The other problem is rather funny.  I happen to have my unit in the same room as the TV and whenever a commercial for Amazon Echo comes on my unit will respond to the 'Alexa' prompts which my family finds amusing.",positive,positive

"2/23/20 Update: unit now sends harsh loud cracks through all analogue paths that use the tubes. Tubes were swapped to make sure it wasn't then causing the issue. Blue tooth still works fine but ...all in all basically unusable. Waste of money for how short lived this thing was. I bet I used it maybe 20 times since purchase. Spend more get more quality.<br /><br />First off for everyone who needs this info and can't find it, here is the EQ setting info I got from manufacturer:<br /><br />DP-02 EQ mod  AE1:Bass boost，AE2:high gain ，AE3：Bass boost and high gain，Eq0: Normal ，Eq1: Jazz，Eq2：Popular，Eq3：Classic，Eq4：soft，Eq5：Subwoofer，Eq6：Rock  Eq7 Customized by software<br /><br />Best Regards<br /><br />Julia Huang<br /><br />FXAUDIO -Shenzhen Fly Dream Digital Technology co.,ltd<br /><br />Secondly, the biggest issue with this thing is... they are making you use preset EQ's instead of just giving you a basic treble and bass control. The tubes that are shipped with this thing suck, but that is true of most china made hybrid tube equipment and can easily be replaced with better tubes to make the sound better. Other than those two things I have no complaints about it, it offers a ton of features for the money, comes with a remote, and does as intended its just really a shame about the forced eq settings. I mean most people dabbling in audio try to listen at flat anyway which is a setting, however, with this thing the flat EQ setting does not really boost the line signal at all which is one of the reasons to have a pre amp like this in the first place.<br /><br />Its so close to being good. So so close.",negative,positive

"I think this product is a great idea but it didn't work at all for me. No amount of moving around could get rid of the popping sounds that were happening about once a second, along with white bars on the tv. I can tell you that the interference was NOT from my wireless router or modem, it was not my cordless phone, it was not my microwave and it was not my baby monitor. What was it, you ask? I have no idea. I unplugged everything I could think of and never noticed a difference. My husband and I spend days trying to get the stupid thing to work, and even moved it all the way up the wall to the ceiling and still nothing. It seemed like they should work better if they had line of sight, so I spend a day rearranging my bedroom so the two parts could see each other through the doorway, and were only about 15 feet apart. It was still exactly the same. Tried all 4 channels too. I sent it back. I ordered a remote control extender and will run cable from one tv to the other.

"I cannot live without an optical mouse, and I got this one at work expecting it to be perfect.  It isn't perfect.  The tracking on it is great - it never sticks like the roller type and it moves smoothly without any jitter.<br />My two main gripes are 1)  It is too light.  It is so light that it feels cheap.  2)  I don't have large hands, but just setting my hand on top of the mouse causes the right click button to click.  This is very annoying when trying to browse the net or work  as it usually causes some type of popup menu to appear.

"Speakers are pretty simple devices which is why you can get sound comparable to much more expensive sets in less expensive setups, IF, you know have a decent AV Receiver that you can tune correctly (typically using a microphone that plugs into your receiver).  Many of the more expensive brands, you are paying a premium for the brand, not just better components. If you don't have a decent quality receiver and have it tuned properly your results will suffer accordingly. If you want a very small minimalist setup for surround speakers, I can confirm as others have said, this is the best value at this price point.  4-star sound but at a 5-star value.",positive,positive

I have the smaller version of this from Instun and love it. I was not real happy when I ordered the large one for my new laptop. The fan's are not covered like on the smaller one. You can actually stick your finger in them (accidentally) while trying to use the back legs that are also not so sturdy as the smaller one. I may try another brand as I have one more large laptop to buy one for. I do like the metal mesh top. It blows air very well and the price was decent. I honestly liked the small one as well as my Targus. The 3 stars are because the &#34;legs&#34; do not stay up in the back and the large openings in the fan cage.,neutral,positive

"27-Dec-2011<br /><br />I really like the [[ASIN:B003I4FF1Y Logitech Wireless Mouse M305 (Forest Green)]]. It is trivial to install - just plug the itsy-bitsy radio into a USB slot and hang back for 15-20 seconds. Once the batter is installed, it works quite well: it has decent battery life, and generally operates smoothly.<br /><br />It could be improved with a ""low battery"" pop-up message for the user. At present, the mouse just drops dead when it runs out of juice, which can be, well, just a skosh annoying.<br /><br />I bought the M305 mouse in perhaps 2009, and used it for couple months with generally good results. However, after using it for a few months it just dropped dead. I was danged unhappy when I shoved in a new battery to no effect. The failure turned out to be due to our good friends at Microsoft distributing a major Windows update that killed the M305 driver. The PROBLEM was that Logitech wasn't out in front of the issue: vendors have to make sure they're checking driver software on nearly-weekly Windows updates so customers don't get the impression that their products are junk. Logitech could have merely posted a ""we're working on it"" note on their support web page; I would have been OK with that.<br /><br />BTW, Logitech is one of them ""ya gotta log in first"" outfits. Really? Why would I want to be forced to surrender my email address in order to update THEIR driver software?<br /><br />I'm not sure what prompted me to give the M305 another try, but it was pure luck for Logitech that I did. I'm tired of corporate indifference (real or merely perceived) and am just going to start reaming their products when they don't perform.",positive,negative

It took so much time to haul outside and setup. I'm older now and much more into small, portable telescopes.<br /><br />This is one of two telescopes I recently picked up. One for me (a white refractor for me), and the other (this Maksutov-Cassegrain) for my son.<br /><br />The kit came very nicely boxed with plenty of protection. Setup was easy.<br /><br />Many telescopes come with tripods that are embarrassingly poor in quality. This one, by contrast, was a real surprise. This is an excellent camera tripod with detachable mounting plate, and is sturdy and fully adjustable. It is a very nice tripod.<br /><br />The look and feel of the telescope is good. It feels solid, the focus adjustments are smooth, and the finish on the actual telescope tube is a matte, spackled sort of color and texture.<br /><br />The image quality of the telescope is excellent. Certainly good enough for a starter scope. I think this would make an excellent terrestrial scope for bird watching and it would also be a very good scope for getting an adult or child into astronomy.<br /><br />The kit comes with an adapter that makes mounting your cell phone to the telescope easy. I wish the clamp was a simply spring-loaded deal, but rather you screw it to clamp it or unscrew it to loosen it. This is a very, very minor complaint because the fact that this device is even included is wonderful. Lining everything up perfectly is honestly tricky, but that is no fault of the kit-- it's just a matter of precision and everything has to be just right.<br /><br />For my test shot here shown in the images, I photographed a neighbor's chimney and roof on a sunny day at 93 yards or 85 meters away. This could give you some idea of what the sharpness looks like.<br /><br />This is a great starter telescope and I'd highly recommend it. Not only will I be using the telescope to view the moon and some of the more prominent planets, but I will definitely use the tripod independently for camera and video work because it's an excellent tripoding it's own right.<br /><br />Happy Star Gazing!",positive,positive

"The sound quality borders on poor.  It sounds as though the speakers are in a tin can.  The sound quality is worse than the 23 year old radio I was replacing.  I gave it three stars as for the price I didn't expect much more than what I got, i.e. value for the price is good.  I bought it for my shed that I use as a workshop, and it fills the bill.  If you're looking for a high quality sound system, keep looking.",neutral,negative
"First, the product is not well-described in the title.  This is the DGN2200, an updated model to the DGN2000.  I can only comment on its wireless g capability, as my wireless n card does apparently not support encryption.<br /><br />Setting it up to a wired connection works pretty easily with the set up CD.  You need to know your PPPoE login and password, which you should get from your internet service provider before beginning setup.<br /><br />Wireless is another story.  Computer would not detect the network.  I had to resort to a long call with customer support to set it up manually.  Even then we had to go to numerous tries with different encryption systems to get it to work.  Apparently, with my current computer we need to use WEP encryption, which makes it a g network.<br /><br />The thing is pretty warm, and the connection does not time out after idle (although such a choice to time out is decribed and shown, the actual choice is not available).  It has an on-off button (unlike my old modem), and given the heat, I am going to turn it off at night-- hopefully that will make it last longer.",neutral,positive
"This is an excellent solution, means we didn’t have to climb into the attic and run cable. We installed it in the lobby of our house of worship which is over 150 feet from the control room and has three walls between them, one of them covered with granite.",positive,positive
Pretty much the same cable thickness as the shorter cords that come in the stores.  Adding a few extra feet shouldn't really impact the power draw to the dryer.  No problems running my dryer.  Have no idea why these aren't sold in the stores with the 'standard' power cords.,positive,negative
"The instructions include: &#34;,,,small air bubbles left after installing the screen protector will disappear after a few days...&#34; I was skeptical, as I still had a few air bubbles after installing the first screen.

"This computer has been back to the factory for repair four times in one year. First the power supply failed. It's a known bug that the power supply is undersized for the machine. That fixed, the keyboard stopped working. Sent in again. Fixed. Then the fold-over tablet mode ceased working (its main claim to fame as a &#34;360&#34;). Sent in, fixed (motherboard replacement). Then some keys on the keyboard stopped working again. Fixed with an re-install of Win10 OS (requiring a reload of all my software -- a major chore). Now the tablet mode works only in landscape mode -- the accelerometer is apparently malfunctioning, but I can't deal with that now, so I'll live with it. Hardware warranty is up in three weeks. So be it.<br /><br />Conclusion: The build quality of this machine is not good. Am I just &#34;lucky&#34; -- millions of other satisfied customers and all that?  Could be. It's still inexcusable. These are design and construction flaws that never should have made it out of product testing. (The WORST computer ever was a Lenovo Yoga - don't get me started ). I'm now thinking that the whole category of dual-mode laptop-tablet is a bad idea. You need a laptop for productivity -- tablets are not for that. And you may want a tablet for convenient media consumption. Two different tasks that are not well-served by a single product.",negative,negative

"this unit is a cheap unit.  the controls stick and the sound cuts in and out.  I can temporary fix this by spraying some good cramlon contact restore spray in the control pots.  I should not have to do this with a brand new unit.  not to compare apples to oranges, but my new DBX 215 EQ is a lot better quality, much better built, and works much, much better, and the DBX may cost more, but not that much more for a superior EQ.  you don't need the super hyped cables, but do use a good quality set of cables for less noise in the connects. the DBX has a very good, low noise level.  that is one thing I noticed with the audio source, it was a little noisy.  I will stick with DBX on eq, as I have allways had good luck with the DBX's  the audio source is not that great of an EQ in my experience",neutral,positive
The unit overall works great clear calls. but as far a free that is not true!!<br />it cost me $3.47 a month in fed taxes which Ooma charge my credit card.<br />they say the will be going up on that price also. which makes me start to dislike this product!<br />I also hate the fact that this product cannot work off your computer usb like the NETTALK.<br />speaking of Nettalk I have bought several for family and it Works great!! plus you only pay $29.95 a yr.<br />I am considering selling this Ooma for a Nettalk. The support at Ooma told me to my surprise<br />that if I sold the Unit it would cost the new user $79.00!!! to activate it!! WOW what a rip off.<br />but there is a way around it if the seller gets with the buyer and update the account.<br />you can set up a personal number for the new line.,neutral,positive
"I have had these headphones for a year, using them to listen to music on my iPad and iPhone as well as on my computer and also plugged into my stereo receiver. My music tastes are those of a 62 year old eclectic, from classic rock to classical.  First, what I like: solid, clear, sound, fairly deep bass response for the price/quality, long cord, and the comfort as they fit over my ears. They are quite decent headphones, but...After extended use there are several things I don't care for. The folding earcups are awkward every time I unfold them! They are made so they collapse into an 8&#34;X8&#34; carrying bag, but that means they need to have several hinges, and there lies the frustration. They don't unfold and fall into place naturally or consistently; I have to fiddle with them every time. This second objection is purely personal, but if I were to buy headphones again, I would get open rather than closed back cans. These get hot on my ears and I have to take them off after about an hour's listening. If you don't have hot ears, maybe you won't mind this issue, but for me it is a problem after using them for awhile.",neutral,negative
Bought these for Christmas for my adult children and spouses. What a hit. I love mine too. Use them everyday. Great to hear text messages read to you while you are at work. You don't have to look at your phone. It can be in your pants pocket. Love the clarity. It is better than talking to people on my Bluetooth in my expensive car. Doesn't sound like you are in a tunnel. I couldn't do without this device. My favorite thing is listening to my favorite TV shows and getting caught up on episodes while on a long drive. (No I am not watching TV....listening) I will buy again. ABSOLUTELY NO COMPLAINTS. All 8 of the ones I ordered came on time and were not faulty.,positive,positive
"Bought this device because my daughter had iffy wifi signal upstairs at the other end of the house for her homework.  Setup was a snap!  A few days later my modem died and I had to get a new one from my internet provider.  Got a much better modem (with integrated wireless router) as mine had been an older model.  Of course then I had to set up the Extender again...  But I was curious which had the better signal - the new modem/router combo or the extender.  So I grabbed my phone and started walking while watching the bars from both the new modem/router and my extender on my network screen on my phone.  One house away, one of the bars from my modem/router vanished.  Two houses away - two more bars disappeared.  Three houses and I was down to a single bar, but the extender signal was still full bars!  A couple of years ago I had run a cable from my router to my Blu-Ray player because my wireless signal was weak.  Now I've rolled up that cable and it now resides in my box of miscellaneous computer stuff.  Extender screams in streaming video!  No complaints at all.",positive,negative
Sturdy cute cover for my Fire 7 (5th generation). Only thing is it doesn't fit well over the buttons to turn on and off and volume control as it kind of us higher then the buttons so you have to really press in hard to make them work. Apart from that it's adequate especially since it was hard to find a cover for an older Fire 7.,neutral,negative

This product can work.My review is not to knock this product in a negative way but more to warn folks that if you do not live near the city (or where the TV towers are) then buy at your own risk.  I was really looking forward to cancelling my Comcast subscription so I purchased this antenna in lieu of a Comcast payment each month. I purchased the 35 mile radius as I live 25 miles from downtown Seattle. After installation and setup I received only 1 channel.  I have to admit the clarity of that one channel was fantastic however I do not speak Spanish so it was a let down. I believe this product works but not if you are on the outskirts of town. I would suggest only buying this if you live 20 miles or less away from city towers. Or if you live up on a hill that faces the city. Just my opinion for us more rural folks. I can tell (from the one channel I did get) that if I lived closer to the city this antenna would simply do the trick.  Hope this helps.,neutral,positive
This product worked for a few months but quickly ran into issues. The packaging has always been flimsy but now it slips off all the time at the slightest prod and no longer works.

"I attached some pictures of this case with the Apple Smart Keyboard so you can see how the pair works - I searched on the internet quite a bit before buying an found people referring to the combo, but couldn't actually find pictures.  The setup works *ok* - when using the keyboard you don't use the kickstand of the case at all - it interferes.  If you don't want to use the keyboard you either fold it underneath and use the kickstand from the case, or you remove the cover completely.<br /><br />I do have a few other gripes which cause the lower rating.  First, as many others have mentioned, this case will probably mess up your screen protector.  I had a really nice tempered glass protector on my iPad Pro and this case pushed at the corners and ruined it.  That was a $20 mistake on my part.  I attached a picture of the corner of the case too so you can see how it overlaps the corner of the iPad pro.<br /><br />Second gripe is that the bottom of the kickstand is fairly sharp.  Seems like it would be very easy to scratch a table with it as it is now - wish they would have put some sort of rubberized bottom on it.<br /><br />Finally, that raised edge around the screen is a great place for dust to land - it's difficult to completely clean the surface of the iPad Pro with that lip.<br /><br />Overall, it's a decent case as long as you don't have a screen protector on, and as long as you understand how it works with the apple Smart Keyboard.",neutral,positive

"I have the 598SE and am very impressed by it. I've been using it at work and it bleeds sound quite a bit. Figured this would solve the problem. Let's just say I am not impressed by it at all.<br /><br />1.) The quality of the audio like many others are saying is pretty terrible. The loss of clarity, sound separation, and further loss of bass is true.<br />2.) The new cable quality is shit compared to the SE. I found the cable to be impacting sound quality as well. When using my original cables with these cans, the calrity was much improved. It didn't sound muddy and no hiss at high volume. The new cables also increased the gain by 25%. The cables are also thinner and is not made out of the same rubber material that prevents bends and kinks.<br />3.) There werent instructions - i was looking to see if the cable coukd also increase volume, it does not. Only start/stop-pause control + mic.<br /><br />In summary, these cans are more fitted for $40-$60 as opposed to the requested $150 it is retailing for. If you are selecting Sennheiser's as your first headphones I would not purchase this, buy the 598SE version. If you are like me and want a closed pair of headphones-this ain't it.<br /><br />Sadly, I too will be returning this product. For those that are keeping their sets, you might want to reach out to Sennheiser and have them send you the better quality lines.",neutral,positive

"We have been told to constantly get documents out of our hard drives and onto external storage units:  floppies, zip floppies, CDs or flash drives.  I believed in that &#34;wisdom&#34; and faithfully followed it.  Well, regular floppies have disappointed me badly (yes, some made by Iomega) and now, after over five years of use my Iomega 100 MG zip drive has gone.  Without warning, it started showing document icons, but wouldn't open them.  Next, the drive refused to even recognized an inserted zip floppy.  So, now, as of April, 2008, I have lots of documents I can't get to.  And, I hear, Iomega no longer makes this 100 MG drive--I've tried to purchase it new, but have been unsuccessful.  Yes, a CD or flash drive is the way to go.  But, if computer history is any lesson, even those CDs and flash drives will prove unfaithful to us in time.  So, maybe we should double-backup our documents!<br /><br />SOME restored faith:  I learned that Iomega's 250MG external zip drive will work with 100MB zip floppies.  Yes, I just bought one and it works fine, but for how long?  So, I'll still transfer everything on the 100s elsewhere...just in case.<br /><br />Update 6-26-13:  It should be noted that the Iomega 250 will NOT work with Windows 7/Vista.  Those selling it do not always mention that.  It works up through XP only. I discovered this when I purchased a new computer containing Windows 7/Vista.<br /><br />Update 2-17-16:  I hadn't used this drive for a year, then recently wanted to do some research with the pictures I had loaded into some of these &#34;floppies&#34;.  In the meantime, by system moved from Windows XP to Window 8 to Windows 10.  I found that this Windows 10 would not recognize the Iomega zip drive.  I jettisoned the program and tried to reinstall the drive via the CD.  No luck.  I took it too a local repair shop--since my attempts had messed up my computer and it wouldn't come on--and they were able to fool Windows 10 to recognize the zip.  So..., now you know it CAN work with Windows 10, but it may take a specialist to install it.",negative,positive

"This Panasonic player replaced another Panasonic DVD player that was lost to an electrical storm - and although I could have still found the older model, reviews led me to select this unit. Not only is it 1/2 the height of the older unit, but eliminated many of the front mounted controls that were rarely used and cluttered the face of the player. In the month of use - very heavy use - it performs flawlessly. The same features such as quick replay and variable scan (forward and back) that I had on the other unit were one reason to stay with this Panasonic series. In addition, this newer unit supports 90% of the types of CD's and DVD's you will encounter whether commercial or user created. I would recommend the unit to anyone.",positive,positive

"After 13 years of service my Sony over ear headphones lost sound in 1 ear, so I decided to look for a replacement. Until they broke I used my old pair for a variety of activities: with my computer/mp3 player at work, while jogging, camping, and while working outside. They've been below freezing, over 100 degrees, in high humidity, and rain. After 13 years of wear, and use one of the phone wires has come loose, so I lost sound in one ear. I've looked at a few different brands and styles, and settled on the Sony MDRQ22LP.  I had a few concerns over getting them. For one I now wear glasses, and wasn't sure how comfortable it would be to have both on at the same time.  I've worn them for 6 hours in a single session without any problems. I've also listened to a variety of music: punk, orchestral, pop, ska, rock, etc... The they sound best in the middle and higher ranges. The bass sounds good. Just don't expect it to compare with studio headphones. Also these headphones do bleed sound. I've turned the volume up at work where we have white noise generators, and it's not a problem for my coworkers there, but at home you can definitely hear the bleed. I haven't had any problems with them coming off while I workout either. The cable is a good length. No too longer, or too short. In Summary these head phones sound great for their design, are portable, comfortable, reasonably priced, and hopefully time will show them to be as durable as my last pair. So far I'm very pleased with them.",positive,positive

"I have an iPhone which is great - except for the ear buds which fall out of my ears continuously. Anyway, I did some research on Amazon and came to this pair. They are comfortable to wear, sound great, and fold into a little origami-type bundle for travel. They even come with a little case/bag. The price - including shipping - just $32! In a world of $150 ear buds and $299 over the ear models is a screaming deal. The other nice part is there's a limited lifetime warranty. Negatives are minor: Instructions are pretty minimal so it takes a little trial and error to get them to fold properly. Other than that, I would recommend these without hesitation.<br /><br />Quick update: I had them clasped together for travel and when I opened them up the headband came apart. It took two minutes to put them back together - but still! I was thinking of returning them but they sound so good, I'm going to give them another shot.<br /><br />Quick update 2: Another month has gone by and they've come apart again. However the sound is so good, I'm keeping 'em. Aside from this, these are great sounding headphones - much better in fact than some costing a lot more.",positive,positive

"I gave 3 stars for battery cause I'm not sure we didn't have them that long. Literally the day they arrived I put them on my 4 year old he was so excited but then he says ""I can't hear anything cause it's going cccccckkkkkkkkkk"" I didn't know what that meant so I listened and he couldn't hear anything because there was a loud static noise loud as can be above anything else the only time that noise went away is if he pushed the button that was on the wire of the headphones.

"This 1T drive is exactly the same size as a drivers license. And the same thickness as a plain old #2 pencil. It comes with two cords about a foot long each. One is USB-C male on both ends, the other is USB-C male and standard USB male. The drive itself has a blue/red indicator dot LED and a USB-C female port.<br /><br />When you first plug it into your computer, there is a read-me file that gives you a web address to copy/paste into your browser to download the app for this. Apparently, the app is supposed to tell you things like available storage, status and allow you to password protect the drive. It also has a really long EULA to agree to. Note that the directions that come with it say that if you forget your password, it's basically bricked because there's no way to recover or reset it and Samsung won't be responsible for you losing your data when you have to format it to make it useable again. I don't recommend using a password.<br /><br />After installing the app on my phone, it said to attach the drive. No matter what I did, it said 'no drive found'. I removed the app. Useless. My phone recognized the drive and asked to format it to make it work right. No problems there. Why bother with an app that doesn't work when your phone already does it?<br /><br />Plugging it into my computer, it also said there was a problem with the drive and it needed to fix it. I said okay, and it looked for a problem but then said there wasn't one. It does this EVERY TIME I plug it into my computer. Something triggers the drive repair message, and then it looks for what to fix and says there's nothing wrong. I transferred an image from my computer to my phone and that worked fine. I backed up a PS4 game save and loaded it on a different PS4 and that worked fine too.<br /><br />It seems kind of slow. It takes a good few minutes for my phone or computer to recognize it. I tried to have it copy over about 90g of photos from my computer just to see how it would handle it. It starts off at about 250Mb/s but within 4 minutes had dropped to 105Mb/s. Thereafter, it had trouble staying over 100 and I stopped it at 3%. I suppose it makes a nice backup drive for travel, but unless you're really set on having a T7 SSD, there are better options.",neutral,positive
Love Anker and trust the brand but this is awful. First of all it is only Bluetooth. You cannot plug it in with an audio cable. Only Bluetooth. Big mistake. Windows kept dropping it and wouldn't recover. For things like quizlet which don't have continuous audio it fails horribly. That's because sound for something like a flash card is only produced in short bursts. Like to say what a word sounds like. The time to takes to receive the single short burst is too long cutting off the word. This is why you must have an audio cable option. Bluetooth only is a very had idea. These are so bad 👎,negative,negative
"Pros:<br />- Acceptable at noise cancelling for a home environment.<br />- Sound is reasonable for conferencing, chatting, online teaching<br />- If they break, you won't be upset<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Not much for listening to music or anything where you want a lot of sound detail.  Mid-ranges work the best<br />- Anything noisier than a home environment would make these almost worthless.<br />- Stiffer than most sets.  These aren't hard to wear or terribly uncomfortable, but not comfortable either.<br /><br />Overall, I would probably buy these for use in conferencing or a zoom chat and wouldn't hesitate to put them in a travel bag to take them on a trip where I only had to use them at the end location... basically because I wouldn't feel bad if they got broken or went missing.",neutral,negative

"I really wanted to like this camera. Construction quality is better than most budget-priced 4K action cameras. Price is much lower than GoPro. Battery life is great. Video quality is good for this price (but noticeably worse than GoPro and it lacks the 4K 60fps mode that GoPro has). Unfortunately, audio quality is poor.<br /><br />A smartphone app is required to use much of the camera's functionality, including setting up the camera and all the wireless control features. I was able to download the app (a huge 75MB download to my Android phone). The app will not work until you create an account on Xiaomi's server in China. I am reluctant to send any of my personal information to an overseas corporation, but even when I tried to do it, I was unable to create the account, even after an hour of trying. The app does not work at all if I cannot login to the account.<br /><br />A few more negatives about this camera. While the video quality is very good for this price level, audio recording quality is mediocre. This camera comes with no accessories in the box, just the camera, battery, brief instruction manual (more of the manual is in the app that I cannot use), and a charging cable (micro-USB, not USB-C like most modern devices). The camera uses a standard 1/4 inch tripod mount, but there is no GoPro-style action mount that would be much more sturdy and reliable if you are attaching the camera to a bicycle or helmet. There is no case to protect the camera from dirt or weather or use it underwater. Amazon does not sell any accessories either, so I don't know how to use this camera in an action situation. One battery is included in the box, but battery life is less than 2 hours and I always carry spares with my other action cameras. Again, Amazon does not sell spares.<br /><br />Because of all these limitations, I can only give this camera 2 stars right now. Maybe if the app mysteriously starts working at some point and Amazon starts selling accessories to make the camera more usable, then I will consider reviewing the camera again.",negative,positive

"Before I start, the people with problems need to read the manual or watch a video on YouTube to see how they work. The YouTube video I watched answered every problem in the bad reviews.<br />The one bad thing is, I try to at turn turn on for work and only one works. If I have time to check the problem and fix it, it's no big deal. But whey I'm barely on time and don't have time to play with my headphones, it gets frustrating. On break, when I have time, they fix pretty easy, it's between 3 things. Even with that, they're still the best headphones I've ever owned.<br /><br />These are great! My other Bluetooth headphones didn't sound the same out of both ears, made me think I was going deaf in my right ear! Not true! These sound prefect! Then they can work independently, one at a time,  so at work when I have to deal with customers, I can have one in and one off so it just looks like a radio in my ear, like the walky talky radios. They also have a cool feature that if you roll them forward in your ear, you can hear fine, when you put it in suction occurs, egret you rollit forward, it loosens but you can still hear and it won't fall out. It sounds so clear.<br />Then!  On Audible, if you push the Beats button quickly 3 times, it goes back 30 seconds. If you push it twice it goes forward 30 seconds. I haven't tried it on music. When I'm talking to someone for work, I can pause it, then when I'm done I can push play, if I get lost because I forgot what was going on,  I CAN REWIND IT ON MY EAR PIECE!  It's really cool.<br />But since I use one, then change ears at lunch I don't know if they can both last all day, and my phone doesn't show the percentage of battery life left, it does on other Bluetooth headphones, but not this one, I don't know for sure.<br />But once I downloaded the Beats app, the power shows in that, but you need to download the Free Beats app. But I have no problem so far.<br />UPDATE:  The last two days I haven't changed my headphones on my break. I wear one during work, works my entire shift. And its great sound.",positive,positive

"Here's the biggest issue with this mount: the joint closest to the camera has no notches, so it is intended to friction bind just like the joint on the GoPro camera case. However the plastic that the mount is made out of is far too smooth and lacks friction. So it is basically impossible (at least by hand) to tighten the joint enough to prohibit movement. Now if you're just looking to stick this to a home window to shoot some time-lapse, it may be fine, but if you're looking to use it in a more demanding environment like motorsports, just forget it. I even attempted scuffing up both sides of the plastic with a coarse sandpaper, and though it did make a minor improvement, there is still no way that it would hold a camera in place under any hard cornering, braking, or acceleration. Other than this MAJOR flaw, I do actually like the size of the mount. It is quite a bit smaller than the GoPro brand mount, but still large enough that it would be solid if it weren't for the bad choice in material.",negative,positive

"I have several Amazon Basics products, and find that they are all good quality products at a good price. This case is no exception.<br /><br />The case holds my TomTom XL, with room (although just barely) for the power cord. The instruction manual fits nicely in the pocket in the top section. The construction of the case is good. We had been using a soft nylon case to hold the GPS, so the hard shell case definitely provides more protection. (Although they call it a hard shell case, do not expect a plastic molded case. This is a stiff nylon case.) It might not save the GPS if you stepped on it, but it definitely protects it from typical wear and tear.<br /><br />The outside dimensions are approximately 7"" x 5"" x 2"" and the slim design makes it easy to slip the case into a purse or carry-on bag. If you keep the GPS in your car, it would be easy to stow in the glove box or center console of most cars.<br /><br />I love the feel of the zipper. You know how some zippers feel cheap and you know it will only be a matter of time before they come apart? This zipper seems to be very well made, and it closes the case easily and securely.<br /><br />We needed a GPS that would allow us to store the GPS and safely move it between cars or pack it on trips. This case does exactly what we need at a good price. The only reason this review is not five stars is that it takes a little effort to fit the cable into the case with the GPS. It does fit, though, so this case works for us.",positive,positive
"VERY inaccurate/ambiguous results when searching for the lost item!<br />  MAY be practical for indoor usage, only; but the already WAY-less-loud-than-described/claimed beeper is pretty much inaudible/useless outdoors - like in or under a bush.<br />  Maybe it's output IS actually 88db - at 1 inch!!<br />  NOT so, in my experience!<br />  88 db is the level of LOUD shouting; and just under the sound of an unusually loud semi-truck rig passing within 10/15 feet!!<br /><br />  My cats were regularly shedding collars, when I first began making them wear them (starting, as adults, both).<br />  My younger cat went through seven collars, before settling down. My older cat, three.<br />  They have safety releases; and I was/am loath to use non-safety ones (my younger cat was getting into scraps with the local feral cat population; and occasionally still does [though much less frequently, now]).<br /><br />  So... lost Rabies tags, both (with those first collars). And also the VERY expensive ($19/set!) bells (that I also quit buying!).<br />  The bells (off Amazon) WERE loud, however. :-)<br /><br />  When my younger cat 'lost' the first collar (W/tags & bells), I spent several hours, over several sessions, trying to locate the exact location of the collar. Made more difficult because I'm in a wheelchair. Maybe... if you could actually crawl among/under the bushes... it MIGHT work out.<br />  As happens... I could get (sort-of semi-repeatable) indication that the collar WAS likely in some bushes... somewhere... in/on this particular vacant lot across the street (heavy growth, all over; near impossible for me to navigate in the chair - though I tried, repeatedly).<br />  I tried from all directions, and could never get a reliable indication of the location; much less, hear the beeper.<br />  I also got all sorts of FALSE indications, over about a two acre area - on the one lot, AND in multiple places on another lot, across another street from the first lot!<br />  Basically... worthless.<br /><br />  When my older cat lost HIS SmartTagged collar, I only spent a couple hours or so searching. No indications - whatsoever! - during my entire, several block search.<br />  Total waste of time.<br />  And this cat rarely goes out; and, then, not very far (10 to 50 feet) or for very long (complete opposite of my other cat).<br /><br />  From the mfgr's desc, I thought/got the impression that I would/should be able to track my cats' comings & goings/whereabouts.<br />  Forget that!!<br />  Again, totally useless reading/indications.<br /><br />  I also tagged two sets of my keys. Less than 1% of the time, my ph app would note that I was more than 10 feet away from one of my key sets (that sits in my wooden desk, and that I exceed 10/20/50/100/hundreds of feet from on a daily/weekly basis).<br />  So, again, pretty much worthless. (I tried using the SmartTags over about a 4 month period).<br /><br />  My other set of tagged keys is kept on my body at all times. Easily a dozen times or more (over those months) the ph app would report me being over the warning distance away... despite the keys still being ON my body, in my jean's pocket... and literally within 8 INCHES of my phone - where it's (two-part) case) is attached to the underside of the chair arm, on the SAME side I carry my keys on my body!<br /><br />  The SmartTags are also too large. In order to attach them to my cats' collars, I bought silicone SmartTag covers. Using the hole in one end (that reveals the matching mounting/retention hole in the SmartTag), I punched another hole in the other end of the silicone cover (only), and then used the two holes to tyrap the SmartTag to each cat's collar.<br />  Which worked fine. As far as it went.<br />  But... they really were too large.<br />  Maybe OK/acceptable... on a 40 lb dog's collar.<br /><br />  As far as the ones I attached to my key sets... again, waaay too large; making it a battle every time I tried to pull my on-person set out of my jean's pocket (while seated in the chair); something I could relatively easily do - W/O the tag on the key ring. (This keyring is on a lanyard, attached to my belt).<br />  Yes, I could/can stand, snake a hand into my pocket, and pull the keyring out w/o too much grief.<br />  But... I can only stand for few seconds at a whack; and, then, only with something to hold onto, to steady me.<br />  Grumble, grumble! :-)<br /><br />  So... I think the technology utilized in these SmartTags is woefully short of useful; with ANY sort of reliability or practicality!<br />  A total waste of $80, as far as I'm concerned.<br />  I removed them from my keyrings, as I felt they were of no real use; and basically just unnecessarily complicating my life - with literally no return.<br /><br />  Maybe your results will be better.<br /><br />  HIGHLY, HIGHLY NOT Recommended!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",negative,negative

"Very decently made flat CAT 7 cabling. For some reason the order I received had white cable instead of the black as shown. That actually turned out to be a good thing though, as the room I installed this in has white primer over the drywall and the color of this cable blends right in. This cabling makes it extremely easy to deploy Ethernet for short runs as it is much easier to staple into place and is very low profile. The cable comes with about a dozen cable clips with nails included.<br /><br />I think that the jury is still out in regards to quality of transmission in flat Ethernet cabling vs. round. Without being able to see the inside of the cable it is difficult to tell what type of shielding it provides. There is no obvious difference in transfer speeds, but you would need to be moving a LOT of data in order to notice a difference anyway.<br /><br />For now, I think that flat Ethernet cabling like this is fine for home installations. I would not yet recommend it for business, government or corporate use as of the moment though. The fact that companies like Belkin are not jumping on the flat Ethernet bandwagon as of yet is reason enough to be cautious.<br /><br />The build quality of this particular cable is good. I would not say that it is great though. It is kind of difficult to judge how effective the strain relief is on these types of cables as I do not have a lot of field experience with them as of yet.

"This is a tough product for me to review. I really like what it does and no other product does this function well, however its execution is a bit off.<br /><br />I have a MacBook Pro 2017 15inch which has a small bezel size. And with the small bezel size there is really no good place to clamp this on except at the very top of the screen where it ends up feeling less secure. Otherwise the clip leaves a weird visual effect on the screen when it is clamped lower on the device. I have heard that this will not damage your screen in the longterm but I am not about to risk that on my precious MacBook.<br /><br />The rubber pieces that come with it to help it hang onto various items are not enough. There needs to be more sizes. There isn't really a sweet spot for some of the things it needs to do. It is either too tight or too loose on my MacBook.<br /><br />This device also does not do well with hard cases. The stick is shaped to fit snug with the edge of the MacBook screen and when that shape is modified by a case it holds much less better.<br /><br />That all being said I am not really sure how this product could have been designed/built better. The job it tries to do is a difficult one. They did their best.<br /><br />Personally I plan to use this mostly to hold my [[ASIN:B01AVF6UO8 Samsung T3 Portable SSD - 1TB - USB 3.1 External SSD (MU-PT1T0B/AM)]] to the bottom part of the MacBook. With no rubber pieces on it can clamp nicely onto the bottom part of my Mac even though I have a case on.",neutral,positive

"I own two of these and got one for my parents as well.  For my set up I run my own server which has all of my media on it.  I run plex on the server and roku, that is how we watch our entertainment.<br /><br />Speed: The unit is pretty fast but it can get bogged down on occasion when you are pulling from thousands of video media options.  It still works fine and I dont mind waiting a couple seconds for something to load, I do not think I have had to wait more then 15 seconds for something to load when I am pushing it hard.<br /><br />Reliability: Of all of our units they have only failed and reset once or twice in the bast 6 months.  There is really nothing to worry about here.<br /><br />Display Quality:  Display quality is not hindered what so ever by using the box, as far as I can tell on our 150&#34; projection screen!  Display is also good on our 44&#34; or so flat screen.<br /><br />Remote Feedback:  The remote feed back is pretty good, it seems to pick up the commands from just about anywhere and accurately so.  I have only tried the angry birds game but on that the motion control works fine.<br /><br />Apps:  Many of the apps require service fees just like they do on tablets or phones.  Hulu, Netflix, Amazon all require the premium membership to enable to apps just like any other device.  This is a bummer if you are hoping to watch free hulu on the roku.  Though this is the same on all the other devices out there someone should come up with a solution for this.  The bright side of the apps issue is Roku has tons of free apps as well and some good video channels can be accessed like the PBS station.<br /><br />I would and have purchased this product multiple times and will continue doing so for additions to our set up unless something better comes along.  Please note I have not tried any other similar products but that I am also not new to computers and tech; and have expectations of how things should perform.  This meets those expectations.",positive,positive

"These are no longer made.  I went over some obstacles to make sure I got one of these before they were gone forever.  I suspect this is because we may see affordable BD carousels soon.  With an HDMI output and 1080p upscaling, this has a good balance between aging DVD technology and current higher res formats.<br /><br />I wanted to give it 5 stars because I love Onkyo, but I was annoyed that there is no sleep timer.  AV receivers of the past had power outlets on the back, so you could use the receiver's sleep timer to shut down connected components.  You can set the auto shut down function in the menus so it will shut itself off after a time if there's no signal, but since it will cycle through every disc (even if you don't have chain mode on, which is just strange), you have to make sure whatever you have playing is in slot 6, and not a DVD.  This is because a DVD's menu will keep the thing awake.  A CD will finish playing and then stop, but if you have it in slot 3 and a DVD in slot 6, it'll automatically jump to the DVD after the CD and run forever.<br /><br />Further, the motor in the one I received gives a really high pitched whine, even when a disc is not playing.  In fact, the noise REDUCES when the disc is playing.  Fortunately I have a cabinet with a glass door I can close on this nuisance.",neutral,negative

So i tried windows xp what do you know BSOD could not even install OS i tried different hard drives and removing anything not needed to install OS. But XP caused BSOD with this board over and over again and the worst part is that all drivers on website are for windows xP which i could not get installed i even tried different XP discs same story.

I really didn't want to spend over a $100 on a headset for my iPhone. However, these got great reviews, so I gave them a try. As others have reviewed, the sound is clear, crisp, and full. While the headphones are not noise isolating, the music is full enough that they don't have to be. And because I use these on my bike, I prefer to not have the noise isolating anyway. The earpiece designs really work for me and I am thrilled to have them stay in my ears! The controls and mic are placed conveniently and there is good sound with the mic. I have been using them for a couple weeks, so I can't comment on the longevity of the headset yet. One more thing, the cords don't tangle much! Hooray! I highly recommend these.",positive,positive

At 180” edges were not distorted or blurred.. and best of all the picture is bright!! (I bring up brightness specifically bc this was issue with our previous old school projector- it never was bright enough..)<br /><br />As always I let you know if instructions are necessary- and yes! I suggest read manual for your varied set up then, keep it stored with projector for easy refresh on hookup- especially when connecting to many different options! **YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO GET A PROTECTIVE CARRY CASE!! Something to keep items contained and protected and all-in-one spot.. Trust me on this one- you should be gentle with any projector lens.. although made for some wear/tear- excessive jarring or bumping can effect units picture and functionality for obvious reasons!

Hence, for photographs who get to click all-size babies, this outfit would not be a good investment. The material is soft.

"Not happy. First off, Amazon would you PLEASE remove customer reviews that do not pertain to the item that is actually being sold. The #2 &#34;helpful&#34; review listed is NOT for this screen protector but IS for the ballistic glass protector. Since it does not clearly state in the product description what the exact material the screen protector is made out of i referred to the &#34;TOP HELPFUL&#34; reviews and one of the top reviews stated the material was glass. IT IS NOT! It is a rubbery material that is NOT anything like the glass i was expecting. Of course the only way to find out is after the install when you pull back the outer protective layer to reveal (TADA!) the rubbery screen protector. I will say that i DO have the Tech Armor ballistic glass on my iPhone and my wife's galaxy s4 and absolutely LOVE it. As for this install it did not go well since there is ,for some odd reason, NO alcohol wipe to clean the screen completely prior to installation. They only provided a tiny lint cloth that is essentially useless in removing specks, fingerprints ect. off a large tablet screen. So yeah, i still have bubbles that will not remove.

"The main issues I have with this dock is analog Audio and Video NOISE.<br />If you use the Video outputs *together* with analog audio, noise will ruin the whole purpose of this supposedly Video/Audiophile device.<br /><br />Fortunately, Video (Component and Composite are clean if you use it alone or with the the Digital outputs (Coaxial or Optical) Analog Audio is clean only without the video connections.<br />Now, if you buy this to get the pure digital audio signal out, then get the $39 Apple Digital AV adapter and hook the HDMI cable to a receiver. So you get clean Digital Audio and Video.<br />Also, if your Ipod Touch has a protective skin, it won't fit in the dock, so is annoying to remove it every time I use the dock.<br />The wireless remote range is not so good, can only control a very limited set of functions and it doesn't have an App for further functionality.<br />What is nice about this is that it is an actual dock to place and charge your device, better than just a cable laying there.<br />If this dock was around $50 i would recommend it. I would pay though the $100 bucks if the Analog signals Audio/Video were clean (free of noise).<br />Sooo, i guess this for someone that needs a dock with a remote plus digital audio out or someone that doesn't have a receiver with HDMI inputs.<br />I decided to return it and get instead the Apple Digital AV cable and also a Component cable. I then can connect to two different rooms and have analog and digital options. I lose though the Coaxial and Optical audio outputs.

"in my quest to obtain maximum channels 60 miles away, this GE preamplifier has underperformed. I lost channels versus the RCA preamp and the Winegard LNA-200. best performance to date is the LNA-200 and the RCA is a best buy with very little performance lost vs the Winegard.  These have been mast mounted to my Winegard HD8200U antenna which is very capable. I also tried the Skywalker 25dB variable and that has also underperformed.  The pull ties that came with the GE broke immediately upon tightening by hand. The GE unit is secretive in terms of power gain advertised but I can confidently say, it must be below 18dB with what I saw. Obtaining channels within 40 miles, this can handle that. Beyond that range, look elsewhere. Happy cord-cutting",negative,positive

"This is essentially nothing more than two eSATA to SATA cables attached to a bracket. It came at a good price, even beating out brackets with single ports when I bought it.  Motherboards without eSATA ports may have more internal SATA ports than ones with an eSATA port, and as long as you have at least one free port, this is a good option. Of course you will need two free ports if you want both to work.<br /><br />Mine came with one usable port and one that nothing could be plugged into. If you can install a card, then presumably you can use a screwdriver. So if you have the same problem I did, you'd be able to take the connector off and fix it. Still, build quality was less than I expected. Hopefully the percentage of duds will be reflected in the overall reviews. But for my purposes it was still worth the price.",neutral,positive

"GOOD: The small (and old) LED TV that I earmarked this for has really bad color balance off-axis. I needed some way to tilt it down so we could watch from our bed. For that, it's doing a great job.<br /><br />BAD: The instructions made it look easy to install, but it's not.<br />-- As others have said, 4mm is too small of a drill bit to accommodate the lag screws. 3/16"" would be better.<br />-- The provided ""wrench"" is worse than useless. You will need both metric sockets and combo wrenches.<br />-- It has a single 10mm ball-and-socket nut to control tilt in both directions. It's hard to get things ""just right"" without it going all cockeyed again as soon as you attempt to tighten the nut.<br />-- The threads on the machine screws that connect the articulating arm to the TV do not match the threads in the VESA plate. After much difficulty, I managed to cross-thread one of them in anyway; but I stripped out the Phillips slot on the other. I'll probably have to replace that with a smaller screw and nut one of these days.<br /><br />It was cheap, does the job, and seems reasonably sturdy. But I did a lot of swearing during the install.",neutral,negative

Once my Kindle arrives and I see it in the case, maybe my opinion will change - but at this point, I'm not all that impressed with this case.

"I was really disappointed with these headphones.  I searched through all the Amazon choices for just the right over-ear earbuds.  I chose these because they looked like the would stay in place while exercising and still be comfortable.  Unfortunately that is the only criteria that they met when they arrived.<br />The sound balance on these headphones was completely off.  I have a relaxation recording that I use all the time.  It has higher pitched rain over low tone slowly oscillating tones with a mid pitch pinging sound.  I have listened to this music for months using two other pairs of headphones, both half the price of the Defway headphones, and the volume is balanced and soft.  The Defway headphones had a much higher volume on the rain, and the rain sounds tinny and shrill.  The lower pitched tones were nearly inaudible under the heavy volume of the rain.  I would have given three stars if that was the only problem.<br />In addition, none of the ear pieces fit snuggly in my ears.  The largest would have worked since they fit over the canal and could have mostly blocked out the sound.  None of the other three tips would fit properly in my small ear canals.  This lost another star.<br />I contacted Defway to ask for a refund and got a response that indicated I didn't know how to use the headphones properly.  I threw them away because it wasn't worth the hassle.  Two weeks after purchase I got a second follow up email from Jeff the owner asking for a review or to contact with any problems.  I again got a standardized response saying that they would take responsibility and indicating how I should try to fix the problem, even though I had clearly told them that I had thrown them away.  That lost the last star.<br />Beware that these headphones might be just right or might come defective.",negative,negative
"I love the colors in the pack.  They're deep and saturated and quite lovely.  The skins thenselves are among the thinnest I've ever handled but perhaps because of this, the fit is not as snug as heavier skins I own.

"I'm archiving my parents' photo albums in preparation for a milestone anniversary, and this SHOTBOX (last time I'll all-caps it) has been very helpful for oversize items, 3D keepsakes that can't be scanned and delicate objects I don't trust my scanner's rollers to not shred. In addition, we are currently decluttering (well, my wife is) using the KonMari method. I've been documenting and archiving things that we're discarding but would still like to have a memory of, and it has made this task a breeze.<br /><br />It comes in a nice carrying case, with a space for everything. The case is padded neoprene with orange piping and looks pretty clean and nondescript. It sets up very quickly. Pull out the Shotbox, lift up, and the back swings down. Then attach the upright poles, plug in your power source, and you're off! You'll probably want a backdrop; just unroll the backdrop and hang it from the back via two cutouts on the backdrop. You get good coverage (though obviously not the sides) and four colors to choose from: White, Black, Green, and Blue. There are also rigid bottom plates that are a bit less hassle to use if you're just shooting from above.<br /><br />The LEDs are bright, and I suggest installing the diffuser panel strips to diminish (though not eliminate) the hot spots. One thing I didn't notice right away is that the armature that holds your phone has a plug in that connects to the back panel, and it has two LED strips to provide illumination from the front/opening of the Shotbox. You can move the &#34;SideShot&#34; phone holder arm around to get the best lighting for your needs.<br /><br />The SideShot arm has wings that fold out and a sticky, PuGoo like substance along the bottom to help hold your device in place. For larger tablets, there are upper arms that swing out as well. The arm has a thumbscrew to easily change the angle and clamp it securely, and the hole for shooting through is large enough for all phones and tablet camera setups.<br /><br />I have an iPhone 7 Plus (so no headphone port) but I can confirm with the Lightning to 3.5mm adapter, the Shotbox's included remote shutter release works perfectly. This is particularly nice; you can lock down focus and exposure on your camera then shoot with the corded release so your finger tap/volume click doesn't blur or jar your shot.<br /><br />The only nits I have to pick are that the power cable isn't longer and the LEDs can sometimes cast unavoidable shadows, despite playing with shutting off one or the other strips. I also wish the price was a bit cheaper, though compared to a scanner (either portable or flatbed) you're getting a good deal. For amateur sellers on sites like Etsy, family archivists, and anyone who wants to take consistently good quality photos of things, this is a solid buy.",positive,positive

"There are so many good things about GripGear's Movie Maker 2 Set that I just had to take the plunge and purchase it despite some of the problems identified by various youtube reviews.  Unfortunately, I have to agree with many of their points and eventually, had to admit that some are showstoppers for me.<br /><br />First, I want to state what is good about the Movie Maker 2 Set:<br />-- Low cost, comparatively.  While there are other sliders that are in the same price range, those don't have the same versatility and portability.  The motor can be used by itself to get 360 panorama shots and the track can be broken down and easily fit in a backpack.  Additional lengths of track can also be purchased separately at a low cost.  No other product on Amazon does all of this and would require separate purchases.<br />-- Remote control.  While we expect remotes for almost everything electronics these days, I was surprised by the fact that many sliders/panorama motors do not come with one.<br />-- Versatility.  Already mentioned previously, but I really want to emphasize that this is a unique feature of this product.  In addition to the points already listed, the Movie Maker 2 set can also be used vertically<br /><br />Negatives:<br />-- Top speed too slow:  I'm in agreement with many youtube reviews that the highest speed is still not fast enough for some shots.  This is why you will see many videos shot with this movie maker set sped up, making all of the videos look like timelapses.<br />-- Lowest speed too fast:  When doing actual timelapse over two or three hours, the resulting video pans too fast.  So while your timelapse subject is moving at the right speed, the camera movement is just too fast, making it uncomfortable to watch.<br /><br />-- Weak 1/4"" camera mount.  The motor is made very specifically for the camera mount that was included with the set.  Unfortunately, if your camera is not balanced or front heavy, it is difficult to get the tilt head to stay put without some grunt work turning the tightening screw.<br /><br />I'm not a professional cinematographer so I thought my requirements would not be very strict, but not being able to get the shots I wanted due to the speed limitations makes me feel like this set is ALMOST what I wanted but it's just not there yet.  I hope that the manufacturer can improve this product a little more and bring it across the finish line.",neutral,negative

"I bought this to replace my ContourHD which I've used everyday for the last 18 months to record my hour long bike commute.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- Image stabilization is great. Some hit to quality but I'm finding 1080p with IS is the mode I like the most.<br />- Low-light works pretty well at night. Yes, it can be very grainy, but I can see stuff in my path (illuminated by my headlight) that my Contour just saw as black. (120FPS is not good at low-light at all but I expected that though so no worries).<br />- Image quality is very good (for the price).<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Biggest issue: lens fogging (because camera runs very hot). Awful and results in terrible quality footage on any of my morning rides where it's less than 55F degrees. I've had some success with desiccant packs but I haven't found one that fits well (really need to shove it in there). I guess I need to shell out for the anti-fog sheet...<br />- 2nd biggest issue: Usability. Can't charge and navigate SD card at the same time. Either is in playback mode or charging mode. And you have to disconnect it each time. It doesn't seem like an issue but I use this 2x a day and it's just a pain.<br />- Waterproof case reduces quality of image and is tricky to get camera in/out. (I leave case attached to bike).<br />- Loud beeps whenever you press a button (can't find a way to turn this off). Also, interval recording makes the picture taking sound... every time. Super annoying.<br />- Mounting options aren't that great when in the waterproof case. You basically have 1 option.<br /><br />Summary: I would probably wait until the next version of this camera. I'm sure they'll take feedback and fix some of the problems.<br /><br />Update: I have now tried this in the pool & ocean. Video came out pretty bad because of the out of focus problem you get with these type of cameras. Above water looked good (playing around in the pool), but underwater (coral reef and colorful fish) were all out of focus. Focus was worse than the GoPro 1 I borrowed the last time I did this, though color was better.

If you've ever used a uv-5r(solid cheap radio) this is the same with minor changes. Notably the waterproof accessory is a nice to have on something that could get wet and is a nice design that make a solid connection. It does mean if you have the non-waterproof versions you'll need to get new accessories. That said everything you really need is in the box. You get a basic ear piece that you'll probably never use is it's the old 90's style plastic bud. There's also a data cable made especially for the new connector. The remote mic actually surprised me as being a little better quality than others I've seen with a nice sturdy coil cable and decent construction. One other difference from a uv-5r that's a bit annoying is to switch between freq and channel mode you need to turn the radio off and restart it while holding menu. Beyond that it's a solid radio. Don't let the buttons scare you as you'll get used to them with some use.,positive,positive

"Nextpage laminated label tape for my label maker has saved my label maker from the trash can. I could not believe it when I went to buy a refill for my label maker, which I haven't had to do in a while because I had bought a bunch at one time.

The tape case itself is identical to the ones I was buying in the store. The cartridge goes right into my label maker perfectly and there is no difference in the quality or anything with the label maker cartridge from the ones I was buying at the store. The only difference I can find is that I am not paying $22 to $28 for one cartridge. My label maker will not be in the trash can now.

Solid build quality. Silver bezel and 1440p were the big selling points for me. Most monitors have a black bezel that is ugly and doesn’t match with my desk theme. It is quite expensive for a low refresh monitor in my opinion and also considering the poor contrast.",neutral,negative

Nice &#34;little&#34; backup drive. USB 3.0 speeds up my backups considerably.  It takes 15 min. instead of almost an hour. I use acronis backup so I have more control of where my backups go.

I use only the security software and TrueCrypt (free software) for the encryption. I use it on my laptop so I need to have small gadgets so they fit in my laptop bag.,positive,positive

"When I bought this, I did not know what to expect. I expected flimsy panels. I was pleasantly surprised with the high gloss plastic.<br />Easy to assemble. Just attach the side panels to the four plexiglass poles, slide the back panel down, attach the lights ( I highly recommend that you just go to home depot and get small tie straps to attach the two fluorescent lights to the plexiglass poles---the hardware they give you to attach the lights is very tedious to assemble. I just quit with that hardware and grabbed four tie straps and gently attached the lights with one tie strap at each end....tie straps MUCH BETTER and quicker--save yourself an hour with this tip. Then, just lay the roof on top, and the hinged front flip down door, plug it in, and you are READY!<br />This is shipped from Hong Kong by DHL.

"I so wanted these to be better....<br />The Good: They are well designed to fit in the ear and they have good sound isolation.  Very comfortable and I have worn these 3-4 hours continuously in the gym with no discomfort, (which is a rare thing), and they don't fall out.  In fact, you become unaware of the device and the sound is just 'there'.  Connectivity by BT or NFC is seamless and the fit, finish, and style are all first rate.<br />The Bad; the sound is good but not great and tends to be a bit flat (though this is very common for small comfy BT ear buds).  And the volume is very limited (and yes, I did figure out how to get the volume to max).  In a loud gym or other space these headphones get overwhelmed.  Battery life is acceptable but not great.<br />The Ugly; The Sony engineers really over reached when they tried to get a single button to control everything.  Minimalism (or engineer pride) run amok.  Over time I have learned how to use the one button but these would have a much better user experience with a more useful control interface.<br /><br />Bottom line; I do use these every week for their comfort and convenience, so they are useable.  Fortunately I work out in a quiet gym otherwise I would have to find another solution.  If your gym or other space is fairly quiet these can work fine (if you can get past the one button control).",neutral,positive
"I have a pair of Bluetooth headphones of similar design but the main button for power/play/answer calls is on the side and much bigger than on this. I didn’t realize the convenience until I tried this pair. It has three small buttons that are difficult to navigate.

They do fit really well and don’t fall off my ears.",negative,positive

"Like many people these days, I’m working remote. Conference call after conference call after conference call. I’m working from home with a house full of kids out of school and dogs I’m not usually working around.<br /><br />1. Noise Cancelling. It helps to drown out the house noises which helps me focus.<br /><br />2. Comfortable. Oh my gosh. No joke. I have two piercings in each ear and for the most part I’ve been avoiding headphones because they hurt unless I take my earrings out. I can wear these all days and they don’t hurt.<br /><br />3. Holy Battery Life, Batman! My AirPods need charging several times a day. My other Bluetooth headsets also have poor battery life. I can, quite literally, go a day or two without charging these. At the very least, I can go through my full day of calls without needing to charge.<br /><br />4. Sound quality is excellent. Volume is excellent. Both audio and mic.<br /><br />The one downside, as far as I’m counting, is that my phone for some reason doesn’t default to the headphones when I answer. I have to answer, it shows as the headphones for audio, then it goes back to my phone audio and I have to re-select the headphones. It’s such a small thing compared to all the amazing things these headphones do.<br /><br />I’ve been recommending them to everyone, from my elderly father to my coworkers. I replaced my AirPods with a new set of AirPods right before I ordered these. I thought you would pry my AirPods from my cold, dead hands. I was wrong, I was so, so wrong. I wear these listening to audiobooks while doing the dishes, and the noise cancelling amazingness drowns our the sound of water and lets my hear the story. I drown out my Rottweiler defending the house from the mailman so I can hear what the CEO is saying in my meeting. It drowns out four children in their Zoom classes all working in the room with me. When I actually need to hear what’s around me, like when I’m driving or when I’m IT support, I’ll wear my AirPods. Every other time, I automatically grab these now. I haven’t taken a selfie without them in a month. 😂🤣",positive,negative

"So I own a desk with a glass top that's maybe 1/4&#34; thick and couldn't get a clamp style mount for my own desk a year ago. I decided to purchase a Planar dual monitor mount due to the great reviews and the appealing look of it. The stand works and I've been very happy with it since I purchased it.<br /><br />With that said, I bought this stand for my GF's computer and set it up this past weekend. WOW! I am now a little bummed out that I spent twice as much for the planar stand.. While the clamp style does make it so it wasn't an option.. I'd almost buy a new desk to be able to use this guy! Seriously. So far this stand has proved to be very solid, has great range of motion (Planar is about 15 degrees to the left and right, this is a full motion arm!). It's great to see the GF smile, but sucks knowing that I paid so much for less functionality. So far this is a 5 star product, but I'll update as it sees more use and we discover problems.<br /><br />I'd also like to add that the instructions are very simple and don't cover a very basic step that could help some people. When you initially  set it up the Vesa brackets are loose and won't hold the monitor appropriately. the instructions basically tell you to take the wrench to a nut that you won't be able to find due to there being a cap on it (massive aesthetic improvement that I'm glad that they included!). The cap to remove is the outside of the monitor that you're installing (ie right is right side, left is left side) You'll need to take a flathead screwdriver to that cap and just jimmy it off. Once it's off you'll need to tighten the bolt a bit. My GF was unable to do this as it was tight already. I had to throw some weight into it to get it to move. However, it did tighten up and nothing broke. :) Now both monitors feel very sturdy and they don't feel like they're falling asleep on you (leaning towards you at the slightest breeze).<br /><br />Update 2/26/2016<br /><br />Moved this down to three stars. It's still a great stand for the money. However, as time went by the VESA mounts (where the monitor connects to the stand) started to become an obvious problem. You need to put a lot of muscle into getting them to stay upright and moving the monitor to face slightly more upwards or slightly more downwards negates that effort and you will be left with a floppy monitor... needing to be tightened all over again. This means that something simple becomes a two man job to get it done right - one person holds the monitor at the ideal angle while the other puts all of their weight onto an alan wrench to secure it at that very specific angle. Kind of a bummer, aside from that the stand is pretty great.",neutral,positive

"I purchased this video card for a small form factor PC. It was advertised as a low profile board. The board arrived with the full-size bracket and a low-profile replacement bracket. The full-size bracket has cutouts for digital video, S-video, and VGA. The BIG problem is that the low-profile bracket did not have a cutout for VGA. This was not made clear in the ad on Amazon. I almost sent the product back to Amazon for a refund. Before I did this I did a bit of exploring and found that XFX, the manufacturer of the board, makes a ""Low Profile Accessory Kit"" which is available from a number of online vendors (but NOT Amazon) for between 3 and 8 bucks! I ordered one of these kits and it worked like a charm. It has the VGA cutout next to the other cutouts, so you will need two side-by-side slots on your small form factor PC in order to use this board with a VGA monitor. OK, so I gave this three stars and that is mainly for the hassle. Once I got the board installed, it has worked just fine and I am totally satisfied with it.",neutral,positive

I had to change the address every time just to get to my cloud settings<br /><br />- The password access is annoying. Some of my folders accepted it and some others didn't. I had to refresh the access authority on the dashboard settings.<br /><br />Others:<br /><br />- The device is slow over the Wi-fi connection and that's what I expected. Don't expect GBs of data to go through in mere minutes unless if you have the settings configured so that the access is faster (Or unless if you have a good router/provider)<br /><br />- The apps provided by the WD My Cloud is handy. They're not the smoothest but it gets the job done.<br /><br />Other than that, this device is manageable and as a person who stores loads of data, it's handy. The only major reason that I gave it 3 stars is the annoyance issues with the cloud not accepting my password despite the fact that I correctly typed my password no matter how many times. It gets really annoying when one has to refresh the authority just to make it accept your password.",neutral,positive
Little spendy for such a simple radio. I live in a small farming community so we don't get radio from town 40 miles away. Nothing came in I wanted with the antenna all the way up. So I have  it temporarily rigged with a metal clothes hanger  hanging from the ceiling and clothespinned to the radio antenna. I got one Christian radio station coming in.

"Ordered this for my office to be able to stand up and work when I get the urge to move around.  I use dual 27 inch monitors so I ordered the AirRise Pro with dual monitor mount.  The system arrives fully assembled except for the monitor arm, however, it is very bulky and heavy and does require 2 people to unload and set up.  The monitor stand could not hold the weight of my monitors and has NO ability to adjust the monitors at all.  I cannot tilt them up or down or angle them at all, they will only slide up and down the pole.  The monitor mount included will not hold heavy monitors, trying to use it actually damaged the unit when I tried to set it up, otherwise, I would have returned this product.  I had to order separate monitor arms in order to be able to use this desk, having the monitors side by side with no tilt is very difficult to work.<br />Because of the size and weight distribution of the monitors, it can be difficult to lift this desk and if you are not very careful, the desk will slam down when you are trying to lower it.  You have to have clear access on the right hand side of the desk toward the back so if you have to lean over to get to it your body will block the desk from going up.  It is actually easier for me to go around to the back of my desk to raise the desk so I am not leaning over trying to raise it.

"Perfect for the 32  inch TV in the bedroom.<br /><br />It tilts and folds just as required.<br /><br />It claims to hold up to 32 lbs and it is supporting 10 lbs or so, since it is a slim design unit that does not weigh that much.<br /><br />There is another mount that is very similar to this one and the price was lower, but upon inspections, we found the hinges on this one are substantially stronger and the unit is well made.<br /><br />Overall, for a light weight tv or monitor, we highly recommend this bracket.

"Easy to set up, good controls, good app.  However I do have a couple of issues:<br /><br />1. Ever since connecting, or reconnecting my Blink devices, they run like crap, not nearly as fast to retrieve info as before.<br />2. Device discovery and info is decent but not awesome, lots of ""unknown devices""<br />3. You can't control random devices that connect as long as they have the password.  Say you have a kid on there with their PC.  You have a profile and their screen time is turned off because of time limits on your profile.  They can simply rename the PC and it comes in as a new device, so if you aren't watching your phone, or say you're asleep they bypass you.<br /><br />There needs to be a setting to block all new devices or require approval.

"I teceived this for christmas 2015 as a replacement for a samsung blu-ray that stopped working after using it less than a dozen times.  I will say that this loads faster than the samsung I had.  The app interface is more difficult to use than the Samsung, but can link with amazon prime.  Sony evidently does not update their software very often, so it will not play some new releases with the newer anti piracy protections!  As of this post, their last software update was July 2015!  Makes this blu-ray player useless for new releases until Sony updates their software for it.  I spoke with Sony customer service twice, even ordered another disc thinking it might be the disc...... Ends up their fix is to wait until Sony decides to update their software, and they could not give me a date.

"These babies are pretty decent quality for the money. They are small but they've got some heft to them, and they don't have that cheap made-in-China look that most speakers in this price range have. They're better than I thought they would be. You can crank them up quite high and not get any distortion in the sound. I would highly recommend them if you want a decent set of speakers for a small to medium sized room without spending too much money. I have a moderate sized living room so they work just fine for me. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I think that the subwoofer is a bit weak, its acceptable but you're not going to get earth-shaking movie experiences from it.

"The LAP PRO universal tablet stand doesn't work very well with my Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" Wi-Fi tablet.  The stand consists of a very firm, 18-inch wide, cylindrical pillow with a soft handle that doubles as a sort of tray for the tablet.  Because there is no frame to hold the tablet securely, the tablet must be set carefully into the handle-tray, and then the tablet simply leans against the pillow for support.  However, the tablet is very easily dislodged from the tray, even when the stand is sitting on a flat tabletop.<br /><br />Out of the box, the LAP PRO holds the 8.9"" Kindle Fire HD tablet at a near-vertical angle that is uncomfortable for viewing or for using a stylus on the touch screen.  There is a sheet packed with the pillow that says: ""Your LAP PRO has come slightly over filled intentionally, which may interfere with some functions.  This will change in time.  This is to ensure it will perform properly and last longer after it breaks in.  The fabric will stretch and the beans settle from use.""  However, this is not really a beanbag stand.  The pillow is filled with something that feels like medium-fine sand (not beans).  Also, the pillow is too firm to accommodate its shape to an uneven surface the way a beanbag does.<br /><br />To adjust the tablet viewing angle, you must reshape the pillow--it isn't enough to simply roll the pillow forward or backwards.  Because the pillow is so firm, you must exert some effort in reshaping.  It is easier to adjust the pillow shape and the viewing angle if you unzip the zipper that runs alongside the handle-tray, but then the pillow kind of flops around.  (The zipper is there to open and close a compartment that is probably intended to hold your tablet, because the LAP PRO is also supposed to be a ""caddy"".)<br /><br />If I needed a travel pillow (another of the LAP PRO's advertised uses) or a tablet caddy, I might end up liking the LAP PRO.  However, because the stand is too large for convenient tabletop use, is hard to adjust, doesn't hold the tablet securely, and needs break-in time, I rate it at 2 stars (""I don't like it"" on the official Amazon scale).<br /><br />EDITED 11/18/12:  After hearing from the seller, Renegade Concepts, I believe that I may have received an overfilled LAP PRO.  (Renegade Concepts offered to replace my unit.) If my LAP PRO had been less firm out of the box, I would have rated it at 3 stars (""It's OK"").",negative,positive

I think it should have read... clean the glass on the webcam where  you are going to attach it.  They use this transparent tape to put on the front to line it up and press and hold for a few seconds.

"There are many things that are over priced in our world - things that you'd be crazy to spend what the company is asking for a ""quality"" item. I'm thinking speaker systems are not one of these things.<br />The speaker set has some nice things about it: long cables, nice style, attractive price.<br />But it just goes down hill from there. The 5 small speakers are low quality. Really low - yes they make noise, but it's not worthwhile. I have a Creature III two speaker and subwoofer on my computer and they produce far better quality sound than the small speakers on this ""Home Theater"" system.<br />Living in an apartment, and being considerate I wasn't interested in pounding out the sound, so this is at a pretty reasonable listening volume. Used with PS3 games and Blu-rays, I just wasn't impressed.<br /><br />Then the system start to malfunction. After my first use, (cables all nicely and correctly attached, plenty of slack in the nice long cables!) I put it on Standby. All speakers, subwoofer and each of the five units made a low humming noise. I disconnected all audio input to the device and it continued. Standby should be silent, power saving mode, and it was making noise - a circuit somewhere was still sending power to all the units.<br /><br />I reconnected every wire and it seemed like the issue was fixed. I suspect though that it was moving the subwoofer unit that caused something to correct, not the re-connecting of the wires. The next night, in the middle of a movie, with no touches or changes to the unit, half-way through the movie, all of a sudden the audio started cutting in and out. Static bursts interrupted or the sound just went dead at times. I disconnected, and re-watched the missed scenes, and the rest of the movie perfectly on TV speakers.<br /><br />I may have gotten a fluke unit, but it's too much hassle to buy, setup, trouble shoot, then send back again.

"I'm down-grading my 4-stars to 2-stars. Normally, I used wifi but once in a rare while I have to use ethernet to connect to the internet on my Macbook. That's been so infrequent that I haven't had to use this adapter for more than 2-hours in the past year. Lately I've been trying to go hard-connect more often. I'm finding that if I just nudge my Macbook, this adapter just slides out of the USB-C connection port. I compared it with Apple's own USB-C to USB adapter. Apple's stays snuggly plugged in until you use some force to pull it out. MOKiN's adapter slides out ON ITS OWN. Which, of course, cuts the internet connection, threatening that valuable download you're in the middle of.<br /><br />Otherwise, this adapter does as reported--it allows me faithfully to power my laptop via the included USB-C port while using several USB devices.

"First the bad. These seem to have some China seller qualities.<br /><br />The first one I bought was great.<br />The second I sent to a friend and it would not pair. The third I sent to that friend and after 2 days she got it to pair but it had no blinking lights to tell you it was pairing. UN-reliable quality control. The instructions are wrong as in press for this long and this happens.. For me I need to do it twice as long. Also these say bluetooth 4 but included documentation say bluetooth 5. Obviously China is involved so WHO KNOWS? I believe they are 5 because they will tell you the battery level from the phone. But the fact that there is inconsistency in what they say and do scream china BS. Maybe they send your conversation back to China's NSA not exposed by an Edward Snowden. Who knows. Can you trust them? Nope. Not if you are a realist.<br /><br />Now the mostly good.  The ear pads work super well to block out external sound. They no longer sell the foam ones.. They are a pleather with holes. This makes the sound quality better .. But if you prefer to hear things around you is also a downside. They are not noise cancelling in a traditional sense. As I understand it they have some way of blocking out the external sounds it sends to the other persons phone.. And what is extra weird is it works extra good if the OTHER person has a set with that tech too. So I was talking on these to my friend for like a month. When i would run the sink she always hated that, but when I got these it was better but not great. When I got HER these she no longer even really noticed. I looked up the tech but no longer remember what it is called.. But when both ends have it it is fantastic. I have never had such a clear call ...for real.<br /><br />These speakers with the ear pads make a much better sound quality than headphones of this type usually have just for music. I like electronic lately and the bass is Impressive for something like this. I personally wish I could hear more around me.. They are too immersive for my needs.. However I still love them and as long as someone isn't trying to get my attention or I need to hear a car coming they are fantastic. I spend a lot of time with them partly off of one ear... And i am tying to source some normal foam pads for it. I'd like to be able to swap them. These block out enough noise I can use them instead of ear muffs while mowing. Not quite as noise blocking but enough, and I get to listen to music. And obviously i would use the foam most other times. If anyone finds something that works post a reply here please!<br /><br />At this price (28$ as of this review), I expected quality.. (I don't spend this much usually for something like this, but my Motorola's lasted me 12 years, so I decided to get something ""good""). But 2 out of three of these had problems! So even though I love mine.. I can't really recommend them unfortunately. If the price drops to 15 bucks.. Ok ...go for it.",neutral,positive

The storage is nice, it's a fast laptop for the purposes I use it, but honestly, I will never know why they condensed a keyboard this way. In my opinion, Mac laptops leaving off the side number pads will always be much better. But I guess I'm just nitpicking.",positive,positive

"10 months of ownership NO ISSUES AT ALL!  Make sure you have HDR/4K SIGNAL from your TV provider!  Picture quality dropped off when I used Spectrum cable.  Disconnected that provider and switched to fiber optic uverse. When viewing YouTube, fiber optic allows YouTube menus to put “4K” in the blank space on YouTube menu! Stays blank with cable.  Using Directvnow service, also getting great picture quality but no 4K on menus but still getting 4K picture. I stream from Apple IPad during day to save data charges while on news/weather channels. At night use internet provider via Directvnow so everything is HDR quality & 4K.  I do not recommend cable tv for OLED HDR 4K TV’s or LED 4K HDR TV’s.  The picture quality just drops off, service tech advised that’s the way it is with cable.  More choices with cable but much lower quality signal which is a waste if you bought a new smart TV BECAUSE you just will not get that high quality picture over cable compared to super clear picture with fiber optic or internet based TV.  You can clearly see the difference!",positive,positive

"I’ve been buying Foscam brand cameras for almost a decade, and their quality is decent for the price, but this is my last one from them mainly because their customer support has gone severely downhill. Be warned!<br /><br />If you’re proficient with setting up these types of cameras, sure, they are a good bang for the buck, but their app is outdated, firmware rarely gets updated and they are CONSTANTLY asking you to buy their cloud service. Their new main customer service person is also quite rude.<br /><br />It should also be noted that the max capacity on the micro sd cards are limited to 128GB if you want to be able to view your recorded video through their app. Most other companies have already updated their software and firmware so their devices can use 256 and 512GB cards.

"I have had my Harmony One remote for about a year and a half. Set up on my Mac OS X machine under 10.6 was fairly straightforward. Once the device is configured properly, it makes operating your home theater much easier. Even my wife mastered the routine of selecting various modes without much difficulty. And, in case you get stuck, the on-screen ""Help"" tool will walk you through an analysis that usually solves a problem. In my case, the usual culprit is my speaker system, which puts itself to sleep after an hour or so of inactivity, requiring me to navigate to the speaker system functions to ""manually"" turn it back on.<br /><br />Having one device to manage all of your home theater equipment is really very handy, and this remote is a great idea. But the implementation is not without its significant flaws.<br /><br />First, the remote programs are basically a bunch of scripts. ""Do this. Wait for 2 second. Do that. Wait for 2 seconds. Do some other thing. Wait for 2 seconds."" While this works, it feels less elegant than it could be. Sometimes, a remote command will not register on a target device. The remainder of the scripts appear to run before the remote sets itself into a basic screen for whatever set-up you've invoked.<br /><br />The remote has no way of knowing whether any of the target devices are functioning as expected so, if there's a problem, you must either indicate that to the remote by hitting the ""Help"" menu item or you must select the menu option for manually controlling devices to redo whatever command item failed. For example, when I switch to my desired setup for my gaming console, sometimes the television does not switch to the correct HDMI input. So, I must wait for all of the remote's scripts to finish before navigating to: ""Devices -> Television -> Input HDMI 2 (which is two screens in after opting to control the television).<br /><br />All this reliance on scripts means that ""Help"" has no ability to determine whether any of the target devices are now in the state they're supposed to be. Instead, it asks questions so you can pinpoint the problem for it: Is the television on? Is the amplifier on? Is the game console on? Most of the time, manual navigation to a specific device option is less annoying than using the help function.<br /><br />There are also hardware and support issues.<br /><br />In my case, right after the warranty expired, the Harmony Remote LCD screen started having problems--it is blank, though the rest of the remote lights up fine. The screen still receives input so that if you knew where various menu items were, you could probably make it work. Unfortunately, unless you only have one device, this isn't very realistic.<br /><br />Support from the company is questionable in a number of areas. Support in the form of continued development of the supporting app is unreliable, at least for Mac users. (The most recent version of the software for MacOS is 7.7.0 released in January of 2010.) The app runs very slowly under the current version of Apple's operating system, (as of this writing, OS X 10.7.x Lion), but you must have the app in order to program the remote. (Assuming it survives long enough for you to add more devices to your home theater.) The app appears merely to be a front end to some web content, some of which is now missing or non-existent, leading to a bizarre user experience.<br /><br />Reviewing the Logitech support forums also indicates that their support is very inconsistent. While some people seem to have had good experiences, even obtaining support after the warranty, most of my research indicates that service is poor.<br /><br />Honestly, I bought a remote in this price range because I expected it to be of superior quality which, in goods of this type, should be years, especially given that most computer hardware remains viable for 3-5 years. For that reason, I can't really recommend this device over its less expensive cousins or the products of its competitors.",negative,positive

"I have had this for 2 years now. I am very disappointed with the psychical build quality of this:<br />1) All three antennas have lost their ability to stand upright, or in the direction I want to<br />2) The hole where the power goes, has loosened the metal contact... so if i pull the cable out, the metal connector comes out too (something that should remain in place).<br /><br />Considering this is a product I rarely need to handle/touch, it is ironic that psychical parts are failing after 2 years.  Also, I am frequently having connectivity issues, unable to resolve, despite being a dude in the IT industry.<br /><br />Edit: Nov. 5th, 2015<br />I am dropping my 2 stars to one star.

"Update: ugh, second day and they do not turn on and pair automatically and only one will connect at all. So annoying<br />These are the best wireless or Bluetooth ear buds I have ever used. I tried them out at work where it can be quite noisy and my patients had no problems hearing me while using these on the phone. Both ear buds have mics so it doesn’t matter which one you use if you only want to use one.  However, the buttons have different functions on each side for volume and skipping or repeating a track so you have to use both if you want those options. I went 8 hours without needing to recharge though they were not always in use. You can recharge them four times with the charging box without having to recharge the box. These connected easily to my iPhone. When you put them in the box it disconnects. Once you take them out, they connect automatically and are powered on automatically.

Bought a Sony product the BDPS3500. The product worked great went we first got it. Then malfunctioned. Support tried to trouble shoot and it was determined that it had to be replaced. Replacement was easy. So far so good. A few weeks later we had the same problem. Support helped trouble shoot it. got it working again for a few days. Malfunction again. Called back to request a refund. Here is where the runaround starts. You cannot contact a customer service rep directly. The support team sends them the case and they call you. Then they won't even discuss refund until you go through the trouble shooting again. At this point I no longer want the product. How many times do I have to get the support team to trouble shoot the lousy product. Try going online to customer service rep. No such thing. Its a twitter blog type set up. No direct chat with a rep. Sony customer service is horrible and I am stuck with a non-functioning unit. Don't bother.,negative,negative

"*Update*: Yep, the velcro is breaking down already (after a month or so). The case still looks pretty good, but if I don't have a firm grip on the top and bottom when I pick it up, the device tumbles out of the case completely. Add to that that the case is way too bulky to fit in most carrying cases, and I hardly use it anymore. The only times I put it on is when I want a little protection from the inner case. It is comfortable to hold and safe to toss around the house. But whenever I leave the house, I have to snap on my much slimmer Finite case.<br /><br />Also, apparently the 7&#34; Fire 2015 does not have sleep/wake, because it doesn't work on either case. So, the advertisement for this case offering that feature is false on my device.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Original Review:<br /><br />I just got the case last night, but so far I'm really liking it. My only hesitance in giving it a 5 star review, is with the long-term usage of the velcro. I rarely use my Fire in landscape mode. So, even after a day, I find myself constantly wanting to either remove the Fire (wrapped snugly in the inner case) to hold it; or trying to line it up for portrait mode in the outer case. I can't leave it out of the outer case for long in fear that I might get cat hair or food crumbs on the soft inner material. That's a lot of ripping it out, re-positioning it, using it for a while, ripping it out again, and lining it back in landscape orientation to carry it around again.<br /><br />I love that the inner case is soft and not fuzzy at all (very comfortable in the hand); but over time, I'm afraid the inner case will get destroyed from repeatedly ripping it off of the velcro strip. I did pay less than $10 for this case, so I shouldn't expect it to last forever... but I can't help but think that a simple set of magnets would have done the same thing with zero wear-and-tear. Plus, magnets would greatly assist with lining it up for the different viewing modes.",neutral,positive
"I don't want to be premature in this review but I'll give it five stars as an out the gate horse.  I've used three other cheapo splitters on my Sony Bluray player and they all didn't work except one that did and stopped.  I think Sony sends such a weak signal it causes problems because my Xbox 360 worked on all of them.  Anyway, this one is working fine and it has a remote that works, unlike my other ones that had remotes that were useless.  If I use port one it doesn't light up the box like when I use port two and the two light lights up, that's weird but it all works.  So I am very happy not having to unplug devices as I need to use them.  Kind of spendy but seems to be built well and has wall plug-in​ and remote.",positive,negative
"My original review is below. I had given it 4 stars. I loved it at first, but after using it longer I have run into a few problems:<br />Positives:<br />It does still have excellent sound quality and is very sturdy- great to listen to iPad or something in shower<br /><br />Problems:<br />Cannot get it to pair with Echo easily at all<br /><br />The Bluetooth in use with overdrive (audiobook app from library) and audible and other audiobook apps- it fades words in and out...it completely skips words like there is a poor connection. It works fine if I hook it up with the cord to headphone port, but the Bluetooth doesn't work well with books...the whole reason I got it was for Bluetooth. Bluetooth works great with other things such as music, etc.<br /><br />It's annoying that it cuts off, while IN use after about 10 minutes. When I'm in the shower, it's hard to restart my book if the speaker cuts off<br /><br />Customer service impossible to reach...if they respond with a resolution, I'll be happy to improve the rating again. I do love most aspects of the speaker, but clearly the Bluetooth issues are a big problem!<br /><br />First review:<br />Awesome, awesome sound in these little speakers. Not difficult to pair. Sturdy. Lightweight. The only reason it's not getting a five from me us because there is very limited info on how to manage any features. Manual explains how to pair and basic functions, but no guidance on other questions at all. Somehow I changed the language to Chinese and couldn't get it back to English for a long time. No answers in the internet. The website for the company had no info at all and I got no response on my question on their FB page. So, poor customer service, poor access to ANY info for troubleshooting online and limited access to any help, at least not very quickly. Also, it's difficult to pair with Echo (although i'm pretty sure I did it once and alexa finds it, she won't pair now).",negative,positive

"The thought of waiting until Monday was just too much for me, so I picked this up at Best Buy (sorry!), but I actually got it a day early and have been playing/testing it all day.  I've been waiting for a Tegra 3 version of Sony's tablet for awhile, and I have to say it's everything I was waiting for, with one boneheaded play by Sony.<br /><br />First the good stuff:<br />This tablet is FAST and responsive. There's no setting for power saving or performance. It does it automatically, scoring well over 11,000 in Antutu which places this tablet ahead of the Transformer Prime by a good 10%. It's not running Android 4.1 yet (Jellybean) but Sony has stated that they'll roll out a JB update in the near future. Let's hope they mean in one month instead of several.<br /><br />The display is GORGEOUS! And the non reflective surface is quite effective without sacrificing sharpness. Yes it's only 1280x800, but without content that supports the higher resolution Acer and Asus tablets, those extra pixels are being wasted, save for text. I purposely picked a standard resolution tablet. I don't think the higher resolution tablets are quite there yet. Anyway, the display is IPS, and can be turned up quite bright. Colors are vivid, and contrast is excellent. They did a great job with their display design.<br /><br />The sound is also excellent, with Sony's ClearFi technology making this one of the loudest tablets I've heard. You can even simulate Surround Sound for a more enhanced video playback. Sound reproduction is excellent, and the graphic equalizer with presets works very well.<br /><br />I like the infrared universal remote a lot. It works well and is easy to set up. You can even make macros now that turns on everything at once, like your TV and Blue Ray player and sound system with one button press. Quite nice!<br /><br />Sony's design is one of a kind. The ""folded"" magazine form factor really does make holding this tablet a joy. It's not just another slab of tablet. It's also thinner and lighter than its predecessor, and sports an aluminum back for a more solid feel.<br /><br />Now for the bad:<br />The original review units that Sony displayed at trade shows featured a USB and HDMI port. They opted to instead remove these and install a proprietary Multiport (which is on the bottom and not the side as shown in the photos here on Amazon). This was a cold, calculated move on Sony's part to squeeze more money out of consumers by forcing them to spend at a minimum $50 for a USB host cable and HDMI cable. What makes it worse is that you can't use both at the same time. One port, one cable. I find this redesign infuriating, because otherwise this tablet would have been the closest to ""perfect"" that I've yet seen. It's a terrible shame that some suit at Sony pushed this idea through. One saving grace is the full sized SD card slot, which makes expanded memory quite affordable and easy, although it kind of ruins the need for a 32 and 64 GB model in my opinion. 16GB works fine for me with a cheap ultra SDHC SD card for 32 gigs of extra room.<br /><br />The other potentially bad news is that, despite what all the major review sites state, this is NOT a Playstation Certified device. I verified this with a call to Sony's tech support. As far as being compatible with Sony Mobile, which might have ps one games, the same tech stated that they aren't even sure that They'll ever release Sony Mobile. Sorry folks.<br /><br />Overall, I still really like this tablet, and it would have deserved five stars, were it not for that stupid multiport. Dumb, dumb, dumb move Sony.<br /><br />UPDATE: I wound up returning the tablet after discovering a couple of potentially killer issues:<br />1. The WIFI issues continue. I got it to stop turning off when sleeping, but after a hard shutdown, it does not want to connect, even telling me that the router is out of range (even though it's 5 feet away). The only remedy is to disable/re-enable the WIFI. This is generally indicative of poor software and or hardware issues.<br />2. It simply shuts off completely in the middle of activities. Don't ask me why. I have no idea, but for now I'm done with this tablet until they get the bugs worked out And make some improvements.",neutral,positive

"This is the second time I have received an obsolete ASUS hub in the box with a current current version part number label. I purchased from two different sellers on Amazon. The USB port of the obsolete version is industry standard BLACK USB 2, and the ASUS imprinted part number on the back of the device is: 14025-00130100. According to ASUS CS, the part number printed on the outside of the box and the back of the hub must be identical. Unfortunately, you cannot be sure of the internal marking unless the factory seal is broken.

Pretty much any flash drive test application will work.  When the flash drive is inserted in the port, A USB 2.0 port is recognized immediately as: &#34;USB 2.0 Billboard&#34; The Billboard designation has to do with the electrical charging specification of the USB 2 port.

Unfortunately I had to stop using this Cudy 802.11ax mesh system after about two weeks of testing as multiple devices with 802.11n or 802.11ac chips were dropping connection instead of auto-negotiating to the 2.4ghz band. Additionally there were some quirks with the WPA3 PSK implementation that may have impacted older device connection as well. The DHCP server didn't appear to be having issues but I did notice two drops for all wireless devices when in use prompting a reboot of the primary AP (even devices with wifi 6 chips).<br /><br />Devices close or within line of sight of either of the Mesh APs had solid connections but peripheral smart devices didn't.<br /><br />The gigabit LAN out port on the APs is a nice feature especially at this price point. I successfully hooked up a NAS and Xbox One X console to one AP as well with no major issues.<br /><br />Based on my impression a few months back the Cudy Wifi 6 mesh system just wasn't stable enough for me. Perhaps with more firmware updates and features the system will be better but for now I'm trusting my old Tenda 802.11ac wifi mesh system. If you're looking for an easy installation process this mesh system isn't for you.,neutral,positive

"This is a great device that does exactly what I wanted....  at first.  I needed to access some ancient 3.5"" PATA hard disks and it was perfect.  and the price was a great bargain too.  Then a few days later I used it with some 2.5"" SATA drives and at first it worked fine for that too.  But then it would start losing the connection during file copy and finally it stopped working altogether.  I checked the device manager and the USB connection simply was not there anymore.  I did try fiddling with the plugs and even rebooting the computer etc..  So I returned it for exchange and received the replacement immediately.  but unfortunately the replacement was dead on arrival.  I was not given the option of a replacement for it, still waiting for the refund (update: received the refund).<br /><br />When it works it is an excellent device at a great price.  hopefully I just got a bad batch and your experience will be better than mine.<br /><br />One thing to be aware of though is that this is a USB 2.0 interface so your top speed is limited to around 40 megabytes per second.  But this is not really a problem because older drives generally can't go any faster than that anyway.  A version with a USB 3 costs a lot more -- almost double -- so this one is probably good enough for most uses.",negative,positive

"I was a bit afraid of the mixed reviews regarding the quality of the sound but I gave the product a try. I used it to play songs from my iPhone and watch series from my laptop. Here is my verdict: you can definitely hear the difference compared to plugging your devices with a cable, the sound is not as rich and there is a loss in mediums. However it is a decent quality enough sound to listen to most songs I tried. When watching series, I had a different but ok experience: dialog was fine but recorded laughs had a weird robotic sound (I guess the quality of the recorded laughs was lower to start with, but I had never noticed it before). Overall, the experience is positive, it is very convenient to connect to my hi-fi system wirelessly. You also have to know that you can't connect multiple devices at the same time so you sometimes have to manually disconnect one. Not an issue for me.",neutral,positive

"The soundbar itself is quite good, the subwoofer is not bad, especially at a price point of $200.  However, there is very, very little volume coming out of the satellite speakers (those attached to the sub).  And, the soundbar does not like to stay connected to my two month old, high-end TCL TV.  I worked with Vizio support on the phone and they said that they've had complaints about the lack of output on the remotes.  They also had no fix and said that I had it hooked up correctly.  Bummer.  Finally, I have no idea why, but it shuts off almost at random and when it finally does come back on and reconnect to the TV there is about a twenty second delay before any sound is emitted.  I know, it's relatively inexpensive.  However, it's also not very good.  The 2.1 version is probably just as good and costs less.  Anyway, took mine back to Costco with no hassles and I'm going to check out Yamaha.",negative,positive
"I ordered this CD player along with player costing half as much from a different manufacturer. I had every intention of using this as my primary deck, and the less expensive one as a backup.  It didn't work out that way.<br /><br />Operation of the deck is pretty straightforward.  As other reviewers have noted, the drawer doesn't fully open, but that isn't really an issue when it comes to inserting a disc.  It is a major pain, however, when REMOVING a disc.  Unless the user exercises great care, discs will be scratched.  I managed to drop two discs on the floor when removing them from the deck.  Perhaps it's my big hands, but I believe this is more of a design flaw than Yamaha would lead us to believe.<br /><br />Second: if your listening style is anything like mine, you insert a disc, perhaps program a playing order (eliminating a few tracks, maybe changing the order in which they play, etc), get settled into your listening position, and then hit ""Play"" on the remote.  When you load a disc in this player, the disc loads, is read, and immediately begins playing.  Unless my deck is defective, this is really a dumb feature.<br /><br />Third: ""Pure Direct.""  One word: FUGGETABOUTIT.  Seriously.  I played Telarc DDD discs on this for evaluation purposes.  It was plugged into an Apt Holman preamp/Apt 1 power amp, and output to Klipsch LaScala speakers.  Cabling to the speakers is Vampire Wire (constructed of four 13AWG conductors. Each conductor is made from 277 strands of wire. Each of the four conductors is formed from three bundles of OFHC, and three bundles of silver plated OFHC. The four conductors are joined to make 2 conductors, which are rated at 10AWG. This cable is laid out in a Star Quad configuration, which is a superior method to attenuate EMI (electromagnetic interference).  I also used the same type of RCA cables to connect the Yamaha to the preamp.  Essentially, with this test setup, you will hear ANY flaw introduced by a component.  With or without the display on, the Yamaha is dead silent (a good thing). Switching between the ""Pure Direct"" mode (display off), and normal, display on mode, yields an almost unnoticeable difference: with the ""Pure Direct"" engaged, there was a barely perceptible increase in volume (measured at 0.8db). I could not discern any difference in the quality of the sound.<br /><br />Third: the deal breaker.  The remote for this unit is a joke.  My audio room is dimly lit.  It is sound and light isolated, and the floor, as well as excessively ""Bright"" wall areas, are carpeted.  The ceiling is acoustic tile.<br />What does this have to do with the remote?  Simple.  It's impossible to see the markings on the thing.  I turned up the lighting, and it was still nearly impossible to read the markings.  I resorted to using the LED flashlight app on my phone in order to be able to see the markings on this remote.  Seriously, Yamaha, I expected more from your design group. A LOT more.<br /><br />Finally, the firmware in this unit is quirky.  Other reviewers have talked about the unit needing to go through the process of looking for a disc, reading the disc, or determining that no disc is present, before allowing the drawer to be opened.  One reviewer resorted to powering down the unit with the drawer partly open. This might not seem like a big deal, but when added to the other issues with this unit, the cumulative effect seriously detracts from the overall experience.  Think of it in this way (an example provided by my wife): ""When a woman is badly dressed, you notice the dress.  When a woman is impeccably dressed, you notice the woman.""  When that standard is applied to the Yamaha  CD-S300RK, I don't want to notice the CD deck.  It should be all but invisible.  I want to listen to the music being played on it.  The sonic qualities of this CD player are delightful.  The sound is rich, clear, and resonant.  Sadly, the way Yamaha engineers ""dressed"" it make it impossible to just sit back and enjoy the music.  I find myself noticing the shortcomings of the player, and that detracts from just being able to enjoy the music it produces.  For that reason, I am returning it.  Sorry, Yamaha.  It's like you hit a home run, and then didn't tag all the bases when running them, only to be called ""Out"" on a technicality.",neutral,positive

"Just the facts:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Good night time camera.<br />-Simple, sturdy mount.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Double-Sided tape sent by the manufacturer, melted and lost adhesion when I had the camera mounted in my car on a 80 degree Fahrenheit day.<br />-Camera malfunctioned and stopped working when the temperature got above 90 degrees Fahrenheit in summer.<br />-Camera stopped working properly (corrupts video files when power is turned off) when I changed out the power port plug, for a dual port charger.<br />-Camera keeps losing the date and time after almost two years of use.<br />Solutions to cons/problems:<br />-I used 3M outdoor double-sided tape on the mount. That brand of tape was more robust for the Texas heat.<br />-I take the camera out of my car when the temperature reaches above 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

"This camera is well made and indeed quite durable. I love the long power cord and illuminated plug it came with. I was not happy that when I connected it to my USB port on my computer the only thing I was able to do is view and copy my videos that were stored on the SD card. I could remove the SD card from the camera to do that and not disrupt it's mounting. Set up of the camera would be much easier to my computer via USB com paired to in the vehicle. I'm not sure if it was because of the device already having an issue, but it only recorded periodically when I entered or exited the vehicle. I took a long road trip and while it was set to record correctly, it did not record. Even when I hit a very large pot hole that really jolted my vehicle. Strange... Made me wonder if it would of recorded if I was in an accident. After just 2 weeks of use, I mounted it in my vehicle yesterday morning in the cool of the day, before a 30 mile trip. It started out working as normal. In fact it actually recorded on the rode for the first time while driving. Just a couple short 10 second spurts. But then it started turning on and off Bu itself. Resetting. It then went off of record... No red circle.. And froze up. I tried powering off and it wouldn't power off. Unplugged it and it continued to stay on. Battery finally died out after I got back home.. It got very hot.. Disturbingly. I kept it on my glass table top until the battery died out as I didn't want to open the case.. Warranty issue in that. Was ready to react if it caught fire. As I said.. Maybe had issues from the start.. But the camera I got was very flaky.

"I received these when I cashed in some of my American Express rewards points. That is the good news, since I didn't come directly out of pocket for the  $120 these over-priced, mediocre headphones cost. The sound is okay, but not $120 worth. No definitive sound separation. Bass, mid and high ranges aren't distinct so the sound is less dynamic than I would have thought for both Bose and this cost level. The design requires the earbuds to sit in front of your ear canal and not down in your ear canal. So, when I used these at my rather noisy gym, the ambient sound requires me to turn up the volume on the Bose Sports Headphones louder than I would with earbuds that are designed to sit in the ear and have the added effect of insulating out surrounding noise. Turning up the volume to override surrounding noise isn't a hearing-healthy choice so these are not good for anything but a quiet room where you have no competing outside sound.  I also have a pair of Nokia Purity Stereo In-Ear Headphones [[ASIN:B0074F5F2M Nokia Purity Stereo In-Ear Headphones (White)]] that have better bass range and more sound separation at 30% less cost. And the Klipsh earbuds are without a doubt the most comfortable and noise cancelling. They are my favorites.

"Great sound. These replaced a pair of Skullcandy Hesh 2s, which were also very good, but didn't fit over my ears. The sound quality is marginally better than the Hesh 2s while the battery life is far superior. If I had to nitpick, the build quality is just ok, not as solid as the Hesh 2. These are rather noisey unless you're perfectly still. The packaging and storage case seem as expensive as the product itself; I'd rather see that expense go to build quality. Others have pointed out the dual function on/off-call back button and I agree, a seriously dumb idea. A quieter hinge design and dedicated on/off button and the W830BTs would be a real world beater.<br /><br />[UPDATE: 2 years later] The so-so build quality of these finally came into play.

And I've needed to perform repairs  of the plastic hinge assembly - I take meticulous care of my gear but the plastic hinge mounts have cracked on both sides, right where I imagine a deal of stress is involved. These still sound good but the sloppiness of the hinge assembly transfers too much noise thru the drivers. I've since replaced these with Tribit Xfree Tunes which cost nearly half as much, are a sturdier build and sound superior.",neutral,positive
"I really wanted to like these. Bought them in January, and due to Covid, I haven’t flown much. About 10 hours of normal use now, and the headband cushion fell out and won’t stay in. Now I have to pay $35 including shipping for a new one. I’m sure it’ll last another 10 measly hours. The active noise cancelling is just ok...it’s not Bose. It also has a very heavy awkward designed headband that sticks out off your head on both sides, instead of contouring properly around your head. Be ready to hit those protruding bends on everything. It’s extremely disappointing to be required to leave the headset plugged in, in order to take phone calls as a passenger, now everyone in the cockpit gets to hear, and radio coms interrupt. I truly wish I could return them. Unfortunately it’s been too long.",negative,positive

"This is the fourth set of exercise headphones I've tried and they are far and away the best. I've been using them for five or six hours a day for over five months now and they've never failed me. The other headphones I've tried either stopped operating after a couple of months, failed to block noise adequately, didn't fit properly, or were unable to pick up a bluetooth signal when phone wasn't line-of sight. These had none of those problems. Much of my use comes from listening to books and podcasts while cycling and these are great at blocking out wind noise.

"The cable does work with my Pixel 2, unfortunately, it comes with *very* loud levels of background hiss when used with my Status Audio CB-1 headphones.

This means the hiss is being introduced by the cable and/or DAC. Compared to the stock dongle that comes with the Pixel 2, this cable is much, much noisier.<br /><br />It's a shame—I was really hoping to be free of the #donglelife, but this is useless unless you don't care about very noticeable background hiss on anything that's all voice or acoustic instruments.<br /><br />UPDATE: The vendor sent a second cable.

"As a happy Kindle owner since an early Paperwhite, I really wanted to like the Oasis. I was able to buy myself a treat and decided to get a new Kindle Oasis.<br /><br />Pros - the aluminum shell is great, appears as though it will be durable. (While I always put my Kindle in a case, I might occasionally drop it.) The page press buttons are very nice and I appreciate how they shift if I flip the Oasis over to hold it in the other hand (it remembers that the top button advances and the bottom button backs up, regardless of the screen’s orientation). I can adjust the buttons too. The screen is well lit and clear.<br /><br />Cons - the dealbreaker for me is the device isn’t balanced. The side with the buttons is double the thickness and noticeably heavier than the other side. While the leather case fits well, it feels off balance no matter which hand is holding it.<br /><br />The Oasis doesn’t have the ability to display the time in the middle of the top margin. I sometimes need to check the time and with the Oasis, I have to tap the top of the screen to see the time. It’s an inconvenience (but this is a high end device).<br /><br />Not really impressed with the battery life either. It only lasts days with the warm backlight at about 40% and Bluetooth off - not weeks. And lastly, not finding the warm light to be that great either. The light level seems to self adjust and at times becomes much too dim or bright for ambient conditions.<br /><br />I bought a Kindle Voyage when it first came out and have managed to locate NOS to replace my original. The Oasis is going back. Maybe I will try the latest Paperwhite.",negative,positive

"Its great not perfect, I'll explain, its not as loud as I wanted, its doesnt have the bass I expected, and its not intuitive as it does not turn itself on automatically when you turn on your tv, as other devices do.  I expected a bit more, but the price was right, it works, its  quality is okay, its not great, I own 3 other sound bars, one by LG another by yamaha, and I hate to say it, but both of those other sound bars are much louder, and have more bass sound, maybe I received a dud, but its very quiet, and also is never in sync with the tv, so you have to turn off the tv sound and use the soundbar by itself or you get the dreaded echos.  I purchased a new tv to go with this soundbar, and tried it with my other soundbars, it wasnt the tv.  So I can say this its great for kids, and young teens who really just above average sound above the tv sound itself, if your a studio enthusiast like I am and compose music and need that bass and extra htz ranges, this isnt for you, try something else.  So again I liked it, im not against it, I think its a bit below par, for what people would expect from a soundbar, the remote is nice and works very well, the remote is responsive, but doesnt have backlights so in a dark environment your not going to know what your pressing, though the sound is in normal placement as other remotes are, but lacks a few rich features like real surround 7.1 etc, its just above what a basic set of speakers for computers would come with back in the early 2000s when they made realtech soundbars and touch amps, which were never really popular.  :)  I again like the device I decided to keep it for the kids, not for studio audiophiles or the likes.",neutral,positive
"Pros: An attractive and easy to use chiclet keyboard. I personally like how the Insert key has been moved and the Delete key is twice as big, so I never accidentally hit Insert anymore.<br /><br />Cons: Very frustrating to use. If you're even a reasonably fast typer you're going to find yourself typing WOrds LIke THis a lot, because the keyboard is so slow that when you let go of the shift key it doesn't register before you type the next letter. Makes for lots of needless correcting. There's also some kind of weird bug in the keyboard where you can't press Shift and Space at the same time. This is probably fine for most things, but it can be an enormous problem if you intend to play any games at all on your keyboard. Need to run and jump at the same time? TOO BAD.

"The watch is in good quality and functions well.  Also it has pretty good battery.  I normally would charge it once a week if I run 50 miles a week.  The charging is pretty fast.  I didn't time it exactly.  I think it's just a couple of hours and it charges very fast for the first tens of percentage.<br />Although it is in good quality and decent looking.  The following annoyed me during my usage of about one month and these may apply to all Garmin watches:<br />1.  Every time after I uploaded my Garmin run result to Strava, Strava would reduce the distance by 0.01 Mile.  I am not sure if Garmin is counting the distance by the top of every 0.01 mile, and Strava is counting the bottom of every 0.01 mile.  But it is inconvenient as I have to remember to run 0.01 more mile to get Strava to record my wanted mileage.<br />2.  When I tried to install a third party developed watch face using ConnectIQ, the status would show it's in the install queue.  I don't know when it will start to install and neither could I stop it.  I waited for half an hour and nothing changes on my watch face.  Only after a night's sleep, I could see the watch face has changed.  This install queue doesn't make sense.<br />3.  Sometimes after I installed a watch face app, my watch got stuck, none of the button pushing works.  I could not record my run until I googled and had to hard reset (hold left top button for more than 15 seconds) and then did all the setup before I could revive my watch.  This happened twice in the last month.  If the third party app would cause the watch crash, then it should not be allowed to be added to the store.<br />4.  When I ran on the track, the distance recording can be very various.  I once ran 48 rounds on the first lane of the tracks, which should be 11.93 mile and the watch recorded 12.13 mile, which is pretty accurate.  Another time, I ran 26 rounds on the first lane of the track with a repeated pattern of one pace every 800 meters and the other pace the next 400 meters, and my watch went crazy.  It recorded more than 0.3 - 0.4 mile for the total approximate 6.5 miles.  It looks to me that if I change pace every mile, the watch could record distance accurately, but if I ran different pace of each mile, then it cannot.<br />5.  The elevation gain of the Garmin watch seems to be too conservative.  Always recorded a number with 25-30% lower.<br />Besides, I experienced the following and it was very frustrating but I am not very sure it was my fault or the watch just accidentally malfunctioned:<br />6.  Sometimes I thought I already started recording, but after I ran about half a mile, I found it was not!  I had to push the record button again to make sure it started to record.  I remembered when I started I made sure the big green triangle recording icon shows on the watch face but maybe I was wrong.  Anyway, this also happened a couple of times during the last month.<br />7.  In the middle of my run, I suddenly found the recording of my run was paused.  I didn't know how and when it happened.  I am not sure if the watch thought I stopped or my sleeves touched the pause button.  But it happened twice in the last two weeks.<br />8.  Sometimes, the heart rate monitor could go crazy.  But most of the time, the wrist HRM is pretty accurate compared to the Garmin HRM-tri strap.",neutral,negative

"The Philips SQM6415/17 Tilting LCD Wall Mount for 19-Inch to 31-Inch Screens mounts your 19 inch to 31 inch screen weighing less than 44 pounds onto the stud on a wall, attaching the mounted bracket to the VESA holes at the rear of a tv or monitor.  Prior to receiving this wall mount, I downloaded the manual from the Phillips website, and I recommend you do the same.  The manual is far from the best, mainly pictures, and like the one which arrives with the package.  If you have a small monitor, then it's possible to hang this on your own, but if you have a set approaching the 31 inch size, I'd definitely recommend having two people complete the installation.  Since the monitor is held to the wall on a vertical bracket, be sure you attach this to the stud and not drywall, and if you have no stud, then construct something very solid (perhaps horizontal boards attached to the studs above and below) from which to attach the bracket.  If you're unsure about using a stud finder, please do not guess or assume you've found the solid wood stud.  You'll need a drill and screwdriver for installation, and a pencil.  I used a level to make sure the tv was even because I have a cathedral ceiling and we couldn't agree on what was level to the eye.

"I AM FURIOUS.  After reading the many positive reviews for Verbatim DVDs, I decided to &#34;upgrade&#34; to what sounded like a more durable disk for the home movies I was recording from old VHS.  I had been using Memorex with my Windows 7 system and was making excellent copies, but for these old memories, I wanted durability.  I purchased this large package, same type, same memory I'd been using, thinking I could finally finish this long onerous task.  DISASTER.  Not one of the Verbatims became a playable DVD although I followed the same burning process, tried a few other processes, and attempted playback on multiple DVD players and computers. We're a pretty tech-savvy family since one family member works with operating systems, but we were unable to find any reason for the problem. One of our Apple computers seems able to burn to these and play them back, but Windows owners, beware!

"Works , but really crappy software driver and support. You can get it working, but speeds are not as advertised. See below.<br /><br />Updated review:<br /><br />  Keep in mind that this us USB 2.0, so there's a speed bottleneck even if it connects with 802.11AC. The claimed speeds are ""...up to..."" 300 Mbps with 2.4 GHz and 866 mpps with 5 GHz. On a 2012 MacBook Pro running Mojave 10.14, I'm getting 173.5 Mbps on 5 GHz band and 144.4 Mbps on 2.4 GHz band.<br /><br />Comparitively, if I use the on-board wi-fi, which is 802.11n, I get 217 Mbps on 5 GHz, and the same on 2.4 GHz.<br /><br />Thus, if you are thinking to improve your local wi-fi speeds by using this instead of an existing 802.11n radio in your compuiter, it would seem that you (and I) are out of luck. You are better off sticking with the on-board radio. It remains to be seen if a USB 3.0 adapter would deliver better speeds, but this one's going back to Amazon.<br /><br />BTW, I did get this adapter working with Linux Ubuntu by downloading a generic Linux driver.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />Downloading the driver from Edimax's website and trying to install it on Mac OS X will make you nuts. The reason is that the install package uses WPS and I'm on an Asus RT-AC6600 flashed with DDWRT.<br /><br />I spent a few hours and finally found a solution.<br /><br />Not sure if this part is necessary, but, if using DDWRT or Tomato open router page and make sure that the option to enable the reset button is set to ""enable.""<br /><br />if NOT using DDWRT flashed router, be advised that Asus and other routers stock firmware often accomodates WPS, which is not secure, but convenient). You should then be able to use the PBS button on the router to gain connection, or enter the PIN that appears on your screen after you install the Edimax software.<br /><br />But, with DDWRT, installing the driver didn't work. I got a flashing PIN that I couldn't enter anywhere as DDWRT does not support WPS. If you're in the same boat, here's what to do.<br /><br />1. Download and install ""Pacifist"" application.<br />2. Go to Edimax's web page and download the ""EW-7822ULC_Mac_Driver"" .zip file.<br />3. Unpack the .zip file, but don't install yet.<br />4. Instead, open Pacifist and select ""Install Package,"" and then browse to the ""Installer.pkg"" inside the unzipped folder.<br />5. After the installation completes reboot your Mac.<br />6. You'll get the WPS dialog box showing a changing PIN and an option to use PBS. I think I DID hit the button on the router for good measure, but the dialog box remained.<br />7. Now, in your menu bar, you'll see a new icon that looks like a cigar with green smoke. When you click on it, you should see available networks. So, turn off your Mac's wifi and connect to your desired network using the new menu bar item. The cigar-thingie will change to a connection-strength bar graph and you will now be connected via 802.11ac if your router supports that protocol (wave 2, BTW, with the Edimax, which is good).<br /><br />This took me a good while to discover. Thank you to ATechpoint on YT for this solution!!! And to the person who mentioned it elsewhere in a comment about a similar device.<br /><br />I hope this helps and avoids you having to spend a lot of time looking for a solution. Cheers!",negative,positive

"Updated review<br />After posting my one star review I contacted Avantree customer service and tried trouble-shooting with one of the Reps (Rie) but unfortunately nothing worked, so she sent me a new set free of charge and provided a free return address label so that I could ship the old set back.<br /><br />She also provided me instructions on how to pair the earbuds & the transmitter that are completely different from the instructions provided in the owner's manual as well as the installation video, please find the instructions below.<br /><br />Avantree Headphones Pairing Procedure<br /><br />1. Charge the headphones using the data cable.<br /><br />2. Using the USB cable, plug the transmitter into a power source (other than the TV) and leave TV off while pairing.<br /><br />3. Press and hold the number 1 button on the transmitter until it flashes red and blue rapidly.<br /><br />4. Turn headphones off, press & hold the center button until the light flashes red and blue rapidly.<br /><br />5. Once connected the indicator lights on both the transmitter and headphones will turn solid blue.<br /><br />6. Press & hold the number 1 button on the transmitter until the indicator light turns pink for a few seconds.<br /><br />7. Connect the audio cable to the transmitter and the TV, turn on the TV.<br /><br />I followed these instructions and it worked perfectly the first time. Now, each time I turn on the transmitter and the earbuds they automatically pair up and nothing else is required.<br /><br />Many thanks to Rie for all of her time and effort, she was incredibly patient, professional, and helpful.<br /><br />I will wait to see how the headset performs over the next several months before upgrading my rating once again, but so far so good.<br /><br />Original Review<br />This product is advertised as plug & play, but clearly this is not true. I charged the ear buds first, then I read the instructions, then I watched the installation video, and followed the instructions precisely. The Bluetooth symbol on the transmitter never stopped flashing, even though I left the ear buds next to the transmitter for ten minutes. I tried turning the transmitter and the ear buds off, then back on again, five different times and the two would not pair up, what a complete waste of time and money. Now, I get to waste more time packing it all up and driving to the UPS Store to return the product. I wrote to the company support department, we'll see if they respond and resolve the issue, but considering my experience thus far, I am not hopeful.",neutral,positive

"I use this with a Mac Pro, which has poor wifi built in. This antenna definitely boosts my reception. But it disconnects when the computer sleeps and is often very slow about reconnecting. The instructions were not clear, but the manufacturer was responsive, if not much clearer. **Update Jan 2016** With Mac OS El Capitan, my computer stopped waking from sleep, and after some testing, I narrowed it down to this antenna. I contacted tech support about a new driver, and in the meantime, had to remember to unplug the antenna before leaving the computer. Tech support is in China, with very limited English. They didn't have new software at the time, but sent it to me as soon as a beta was available. Had to uninstall the previous version to install the beta. Beta didn't work, and I'm unable to get the old software reinstated and functioning, and tech support just told me to Google it, as they can't Google in China. I now have NO functioning wifi basically and am quite unhappy.",negative,positive

It is big but not heavy and it is the size that makes it uncomfortable after a day of wearing it. It does not link all that well with my phone, not as far as basic functions, but rather in not allowing voice commands readily.

This is my second Oontz Angle (Plus and now Ultra). Love the sound and form factor. Can’t say anything positive about the Micro USB connection. Both have quickly loosened and no matter which USB connector that I use (Oontz or other) the connection is so loose and sloppy that it is almost impossible to get a connection that will recharge the battery. I feel foolish for buying a second Oontz hoping that I would have better and reliable USB connections. This is the Achilles heel of what is otherwise a great unit. What good is it if you can’t get a reliable connection to charge the device?  Seems like the angle where the USB is positioned works against it as the weight of the charging cable invariably pulls downward on the connector causing irreversible loosening of the port. Can’t recommend Oontz in its current configuration.,negative,positive

"Pleasantly surprised by this USB DAC/amp combo. I purchased it to drive a pair of Sennheiser HD555 headphones for music on my PC, which don't need a whole lot of amplification at 50 ohms, but come to life given ample power (and sound flat otherwise.) My goal was to get clean sound with minimal to no latency, and while the words &#34;USB sound card of sorts&#34; crossed my mind a few times, I'm glad to find no discernible lag added to sound output from this device. The sound is also very clean and well driven for these particular headphones, with plenty of room to grow. Using a system volume of ~99% and the amp on &#34;low gain&#34; setting, comfortably loud listening is obtained at &#34;4&#34; on the potentiometer (out of 8, 1 o'clock) but your results may vary based on the power needs of your headphones. Even when &#34;maxing it out&#34; (high gain, max volume) there is no noise transmitted through the circuitry, which is nice to (not) hear. This was with no playback, mind you!<br /><br />Works just fine plugging in and using default OS drivers in both Windows 7 x64 and OS X 10.4 El Capitan. No fuss in either case, and recognized as &#34;E10K.&#34; Construction looks good, and has a nice solid metal feel to it. Contacts are all gold, and outside of the included flimsy micro USB cable, it exudes quality craftsmanship. Volume knob feels nice and has a suitable resistance to it. Gain and bass boost switches have a nice, solid click to them. Cannot comment on the alternate outputs (coaxial, auxiliary line out) because I have not used them, but do know that these are passthroughs that are not amplified -- only the front-facing headphone port is. Comes packaged with 6 small plastic feet that can be applied to the device wherever you wish. It is also small and light enough to be mounted just about anywhere (e.g. over/under a desk.)<br /><br />No real complaints to speak of; I'm not a fan of the bass boost function, but it's just icing on the cake to me. Be aware that this is not a stand-alone DAC/amp, and essentially acts as an external USB sound card. I've read of it working on rooted Android devices that can deliver enough power via their battery, but this is an edge case, and I otherwise wouldn't recommend it to someone looking to use it outside of a PC.<br /><br />Edited: Sennheiser HD555 are 50 ohm, not 32 ohm.<br /><br />Update 01/09/17: Still using and loving this USB DAC/amp. I've since delved a little deeper into the rabbit hole of headphones and bought a &#34;few&#34; new pairs, all of which are powered quite well by this product. All of the following headphones worked great: AKG K702 and K712/K7XX, Audio-Technica ATH-M40x and ATH-M50x, Beyerdynamic DT880 Pro (80 ohm version,) Fostex T50RP Mk. III, and Sennheiser HD600. The latter two pairs seem to be the &#34;limit&#34; of what this DAC/amp can successfully power. With the Fostex, I need to use high gain with the knob at about 75% for comfortable listening, and 100% for loud-and-slightly-uncomfortable action. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this DAC/amp to anyone, unless I knew they were pairing it with absolute top shelf monsters of headphones that cost (way) more than thrice the price of the E10K.",positive,positive

"While this case is billed on Amazon as being for a MacBook, there's nothing about the product that makes it Mac-specific. The tag implies that it will fit any 13.3"" laptop. In fact, I think the design of the case is somewhat antithetical to the design aesthetics of a Mac. It's a basic black rectangle laptop sleeve which is more suited for a nondescript PC notebook.<br /><br />- The inside measures approximately 13.25"" x 9.25"" and is lined with felt-like material.<br /><br />- There are no pockets. While this would make sense if this was truly a thin sleeve, the case is actually a little bit bulky as sleeve.<br /><br />- Includes a detachable shoulder strap, which is pretty basic. There is no padding - just a thin strap which trends to slide off the shoulder and can make you sore if your laptop is heavy.<br /><br />- The front of the case is a matte rubbery material with glossy black chevron stripes. I find it to be rather ugly. The material tends to look dirty after only a little bit of use, especially if you have oily hands. It does clean up with water (and a little soap sometimes), but is annoying. The back looks like standard canvas-like material, but seems to have been impregnated with something to make it water repellent.<br /><br />- Decent water-resistance. I zipped up the case and dunked it into a bucket of water several times. The case seems to have a good degree of protection. Most of the case repels the water very well and the seams seem to be tight as well - though I don't think they're sealed. The only part of the case that let in visible water was the zipper - but it was very little. While the area around the seams did feel slightly damp, I think the case would perform well during normal use through rainstorms or coffee spills.<br /><br />- There are flaps of thin fabric which stick out near the zipper. I've had the zipper catch on a few times. Bad design.<br /><br />- Seems overpriced for what it is.",neutral,positive

"Sounds great but can't take the heat.<br />The unit provides great sound, it has easy controls compared to some I have had that have tons of controls.<br />FM receiver works well too.<br />The main HUGE problem is when it gets warm/hot it turns off.<br />We even bought some high velocity fans and put them on the top air vents to keep them cooler and this did not help.<br />Brides hate it when their music suddenly goes off during their Father Daughter dance.<br /><br />We have only had them since fall and will try and return them, we also bought the extended warranty.<br />So, if we can't get our $$$ back here from Amazon, we will shoot for new fresh units and sell them on Craigs list to make up for the alternate units we just ordered.  I think a factor is that they are only 50w and have to work to hard to produce enough volume.",negative,positive

"First, a reality check. This is a low cost monitor when you consider the IPS technology, the resolution and screen size. Adjust expectations accordingly!<br /><br />Although IPS the screen is wide enough that at close range the screen darkens appreciably towards the left and right edges - move your head to the left or right and the banding disappears. The color does not wash out towards the edges so the screen is definitely IPS. Perhaps this is why curved screens are popular? If your graphic card has vignette adjustments, you might want to try playing with the settings.<br /><br />In terms of connections, some DVI-D cables will struggle at the native resolution. The DVI-D connection does work, but I needed to use a quality, fully pin-populated DVI-D cable to get native resolution. However HDMI worked perfectly, even using a 10 foot cable of dubious quality. Starting out I'd suggest you set the resolution to 1900 x 1200 (or something in that range), then experiment with cables. Also check your graphic card is capable of DVI-D output at the native resolution! I do wish they had opted for 2 HDMI connectors rather than 1 HDMI + 1 DVI-D. Because Netflix / Amazon etc. refuse (stupidly) to work with VPN solutions, I want to have a picture-in-picture solution using a Fire TV stick (which is HDMI of course). The easiest solution will be to upgrade my graphic card to one that supports Display Port output.<br /><br />Assembly was easy. There are 4 screws already inserted into the case for the VESA mount. Remove the screws and re-use for the stand (assuming you're not using VESA of course).<br /><br />I read a few complaints the screen is not bright enough. Actually I found the default brightness sufficient to make my eyes sore - so I backed off the brightness. It's definitely worth playing with the out-of-the-box settings (more-so than any 24 inch IPS display I've owned).<br /><br />My screen had zero dead pixels and no stuck pixels. This is the 3rd Acer I've bought and they were all perfect.<br /><br />Controls are easy to use (the menu options align cleverly with the buttons under the low, right-hand edge of the screen. No complaints.<br /><br />I really wanted a black casing however I found that aside from a 1/16th inch surrounding border, you really can't see the white casing from the front. So not a problem for me.<br /><br />Overall then, very good value, functions perfectly.",positive,positive

"I've always had about 600$ Toshiba's so this is my first laptop that was more than $1,000.<br />I'm used to having a SATA SSD so casual usage isn't noticeably faster.<br />Boot times and coming back from sleep actually seems to take longer I assume because this has windows 10 home and not pro which lets you disable the login screen.<br />Purchased this at $1,299 after buying an Acer Predator Helios that arrived with screen bleed on first boot. Thought it might resolve itself with a windows update and did not so I returned it.<br /><br />The keyboard is a little bit more cramped and will take some getting used to but is super customizable.<br />I'd like for the shift/fn keys to be backlit as well i.e. volume up/down and symbols.<br />Most people seem to have one big gripe with the system and mine is the trackpad. Generic drivers, unknown manufacturer so I can't find a way to get momentum or inertia into use.<br /><br />The display is nice, passes the one finger test, doesn't wobble any more than other laptops I've had.<br />I Haven't used it on battery yet, at least not for any stretch of time.<br />Does not have a mux switch, uses some NVidia thing to manage GPU.<br />6GB Video card according to DirectX.<br />The camera is at the bottom of the screen so if you place it low, you get a low angle.<br />I haven't had issues with the AORUS control center app. Seems to work just fine.<br />8/27/22 Update: Aorus control center app is a nightmare to get working.<br /><br />Doesn't get any louder than my old Toshiba with casual use.<br />Doesn't get noticeably warm with casual usage.<br />The bird on the back of the screen does light up white when on.<br /><br />My favorite part so far is that the Wifi on this system seems to be so much faster than my Toshiba. Imgur switches posts really fast. Followed by the screen.<br /><br />Pictures:<br />2nd SSD Slot, components, RAM, motherboard overall, and lastly the back of the laptop lid at night.<br />Note: All the screws to remove the laptops underplate appear to be the same length, also was pretty easy to remove compared to some other laptops which really snap a lot when you open them.",positive,positive
"Not too sure what to make of it, I was hoping the device will allow me to pan easily so that I can take wide landscape pictures.

"I bought this to give my laptop protection during travel. It does that. It also gives me space to possibly put the iPad in the pocket along with the laptop.<br /><br />Because of that, when you only have A 2021 MacBook Pro, it’s not held tight in the case. It’s slightly rattles around. But the surfaces are padded and I think it’ll be fine.<br /><br />The case only opens 90°. So that could be a problem for some people that want to open their laptop farther if you were going to use it in the case. Also the gussets that hold it at the 90° mark tend to get stuck inside your laptop if you close them both at the same time. Not a big deal. The shoulder strap loops are large ballistic nylon and may not fit some shoulder strap attachments. But it comes with one, so you should be OK.",neutral,negative
When I first tried these I was a little disappointed. Way too much bloated mid bass and not enough highs. After a bit of burn in the bass tightened a little but the highs are still quite recessed. It requires some EQ to get it right but when you do these are pretty sweet sounding phones. The bass in these things will make your head numb! Although I wish they truly hit the sub bass frequencies. With the EQ I use (Equalizer APO for Windows) I can adjust any frequency I want and anything under 30Hz doesn't really register on these phones. I would've given them four stars if they didn't require EQ.,neutral,positive

"I've purchased 3 of these Wasabi BP-827 replacement batteries for my Canon Vixia HG21 Camcorder so far.<br />They've all died within a year unfortunately.  I see all the glowing reviews for this battery, but honestly, I haven't seen a review from a customer who have used their battery for more than just a month, or even more than just a couple of days for that matter.  Most of the reviews are posted only after a few days of use.  I want to know that a battery can last and hold 70% its charge even after 300 charge cycles.  These unfortunately didn't last beyond their 150-200th charge as they all just died on me and won't even power on the camcorder anymore.<br /><br />Since they're fairly cheap, I won't say it's a terrible purchase.

Razer is well known for their tech equipment. Their headphones and earbuds in particular are coveted items. This upgraded version is just plain fantastic.

"As somebody who enjoys having low profile headphones on to listen to podcasts as I go about my day, these headphones are great. They fit well with my bicycle helmet and I can hear other people/sounds around me as they don't plug my ears. I also like the fact that I've never had a problem from sweat or rain. Battery life is roughly as advertised and the interface is simple.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they barely fit because of my large hat size. The measured cable length between ear pieces is on the short side from the advertising (depending how they're measuring). This causes them to sit at an odd angle on my head. I believe that this is also part of the reason why the microphone is unusable for me. My daughter now uses them and is able to comfortably use the microphone. The comments about there being poor bass sound are true, so these should not be your first choice for if you care about audiophile sound reproduction.<br /><br />I'd pay a premium for an XL version of any bone conduction headphones, but so far it seems that all of them are on the small side to avoid excess wires at the back of the head.",neutral,positive

"I got this watch as a replacement for my old Forerunner 305 which I have had for about 6-7 years.<br /><br />First off, getting this watch to connect to the wireless ant dongle is very hit or miss.  I really do not understand why they would give you a USB cable for charging, but not make it work for data transfers as well.  The ant agent software crashes if it loads at all, there have been no updates to it since October 2013.  The software that comes with it Garmin Express is also crap!  The only way to upload your activities is if you are connected to the internet and able to connect to their servers and it requires you to logon to your account EVERY time you try to sync.<br /><br />Second, the connect site has become my favorite for keeping my runs.  I have used mapmyrun,com, strava.com and several other softwares/sites.  The only thing I wish it did was allow you to track your gear as well.<br /><br />Now for the device.<br /><br />Yes, as others have stated, it does feel much lighter and smaller than my old 305.  Visually, they are almost identical, so I am guessing it is due to the flat back of this watch.<br /><br />The watch software and functionality is very similar to my old 305 with some noted improvements.  The first week I got this monitor, I wore both devices while doing my lunch runs around the track at work.  Note, I run with two other guys that also have 305's and we would NEVER have the same distance on our runs even though we normally ran side by side.  With the 310, I get very consistent distances over runs.  With the two devices, both registered my HR exactly the same, but the 305 was normally about 0.1 mile off after a 5 mile run.  That may not seem like much, but it did explain the problems we had with our three 305's having different distances for the same run.<br /><br />While wearing both monitors, in the middle of a parking lot with very little clouds.  The 310 showed it was accurate to about 10 feet, the 305 showed it was between 18-21 feet<br /><br />Something that I really do like is the recovery HR that is does for you.  Once you finish your activity and hit the stop button, it will track your HR for the next two minutes then give you what your recovery heart rate is.<br /><br />Also, if you loose or break the ANT Dongle, it is about $45 for a new one.  And without one, you are not able to transfer any data to/from the watch.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with the watch, the only complaints I have is with the software and data transfer methods that Garmin went with in this model.",neutral,positive

"When it comes to headphones lately that you purchase online, I am seldom ever finding any that work like these two. I have old headphones from 25 years ago that still work flawlessly yet I constantly am going through headphones at least once a year, mostly due to the poor quality of plastic that used. Unfortunately I see the same type of quality in these headphones. Why there adequate in nature they are not at a high-end or even medium and in quality. These are more something that he would find it your discount store but they do work. I did not return them because I needed them simply for a monitoring on my podcast.

"This small flash drive is an excellent product.  So many flash drives are made with cheap plastic, are light and flimsy, making one think they are meant to be disposable.  Not this drive - it is very very sturdily built with an aluminum casing, a comforting weight, and curves in all the right places.  In short, it just feels right in my hand.<br /><br />But all the nicely designed devices are nothing if they do not work well.  This flash drives works well.  Actually, it works great.

"Once you get past the somewhat strange interface, the music player is a joy to use. I only use it for music for when I'm walking. I haven't tried the video or e-book features. But for music, it is great. I've saved over 50 hours of music, and the playback is crystal clear. Getting music on the device was a little non-intuitive. In my case, my music was on my Windows 10 desktop. The music was arranged in folders where each folder represented an album. I used the USB cord included with the device to connect to my desktop. Windows found the device and recognized it as an external drive. Then I simply cut and pasted the music/album folders from my desktop to the player. Of course, the player needs to be on during this operation. Then connect your headphones and go to the main menu on the player. Select ""Folders"" not music (the music note icon). You will see your albums under the Folders icon (second row, far left). Again, the interface takes some getting used to, but the device is attractive, light, inexpensive, and best of all, reproduces music beautifully. I'm very happy with the purchase.<br /><br />Edit (4/2/2021) While there is a lot to like about this device, I have to knock two stars off due to a faulty earplug port. After almost daily use for months, the sound recently started cutting out randomly. I thought it was my Apple earplugs--the kind you get with the older iPhones. So I bought a new pair of earplugs. Same problem. The port has become loose so the earplug plug no longer fits tightly. I like this little device enough I may end up buying another one. I'm sure the manufacturer won't stand behind the one I have. It's too bad really, otherwise I would give this 5 stars.",neutral,positive

Second,  two of the Carabiner Clips do not operate properly, they would not open although the other three worked fine. I worked with the two that were stuck shut and they now open but begrudgingly.  The last time I ordered these Earbud Cases everyone was fine so I'm guessing the zipper was a one off defect, the Carabiner Clips may be a manufacturing issue since their was more than one with a the same problem.  I emailed the seller twice once in reply to their email asking if everything was OK and again from amazons contact the seller feature. I gave this seller overall 3 stars based on the non response emails about the defective items. If I had heard from the seller to begin I wouldn't be writing this review.",neutral,negative
"After seeing the slick &#34;InCase&#34; cases for macs, I wanted to get something that would add a bit of protection to my new XPS 13, and maybe look  cool at the same time. Well, I got at least one of the two.<br /><br />The case fits a little boxy, covering up all the smooth lines and surfaces of the XPS 13 with hard plastic corners and a featureless exterior. No logo, no see-through, no nuthin.  And honestly I  kinda like it. It makes my expensive new laptop look much more &#34;run-of-the-mill&#34; and discreet. I  feel like the ugly case is honestly a bonus because my laptop might be less appealing to thieves?<br /><br />But it still doesn't fit quite right, and I'm dubious about the added protection (just hold on a minute whilst I chuck this new laptop across the room)",neutral,negative

The charger is cheap and it doesn't really fit into the hole properly, leading one to believe its not in all the way because it doesn't fully seat, which also leads to it not charging if the cable is not applying tension to the charging plug.

I made the mistake of trying to hardwire using a cut off phone cord.  My LRD950 would sometimes say &#34;low battery&#34; which I now realize was because the phone cord gauge was too thin to carry sufficient current.

"I tried this card (which is powered to cover the 4 ports) after returning two inateck 2-port no-power cards. All have the same issue: the headers do not work. When I plug each of my USB 3.0 (2 port) devices into my ATX mobo (separately as mobo only has one USB 3 header), the ports work for USB 3.0 flash drives. When I plug the same devices into the PCiE cards, no headers work. No drives recognized. I bought a new Samsung USB 3.0 flash drive to make sure it was not the flash drives I was currently using (in the case of a new Lexar and an old PNY, the drives were being problematic). All of the cards have working USB 3.0 ports. If you're buying this (as I did)  to gain an extra header for front USB 3.0 ports, you may want to think again. For each that I have tried, there have been reviews of the headers working. I wish I could report the same.<br />EDIT: USB A ports won't handle a powered HD dock AND a logitech mouse dongle. The USB C port won't read my new Samsung T5 drive. The USB A drives do read it.",negative,positive
"I do not recommend this product. The sound itself was great. It was comfortable for the most part, had great range, and a great battery life.

"I bought this to play mp3 audiobooks. Chapters can be very long tracks (60+ minutes). It woud be ideal if at the moment of powering back on, you could resume where you left off without much hassle. But in order to do that, you need to go through the menu: first “Music”, then “Last played” and touch the center button. It turns out I was approaching the task from a wrong perspective and getting lost in the menus, which was a bit frustrating. It would be much easier if the “Last played” screen was the Home Screen and access the menus from there.<br />The lack of metadata on display forces you to rename the tracks and fit as much info as you can into the filename to be able to identify your audiobook chapters easily.",neutral,positive

"Overall the case is what it is.  If you want a light weight case that semi-resembles a composition notebook then this is good for that.  I was hoping for a bit better construction and a more realistic notebook feel so it worked as a theft deterrent, hiding the Ipad from sight, however when laid down you can plainly see the Ipad from all sides.

If that is what you are looking for then this is perfect for you.  Great price and will protect the iPad from minor drops and bumps.",neutral,positive

"I bought this voice recorder a few years ago because it was well-reviewed in terms of sound quality and price.<br /><br />Then, I couldn't figure out how to use it, so I put it to one side until today, when it seemed like a good, compact option for recording dictation when I don't want to use my phone.<br /><br />I put fresh batteries in it, took out the RCA Users Manual, and... well, this was NOT fun.<br /><br />I'll start with one good point about this recorder: Yes, if you can figure out how to set the recorder - which is NOT intuitive and VERY difficult to understand - the sound quality IS good.<br /><br />However, when you want to adjust the settings and the directions say to click on something that looks like a little box, what they ACTUALLY mean is to click the ""off"" button. Yes, if you hold the recorder at a certain angle, you'll see a little square indentation on the little black button. The easy-to-read silver lettering over the button...? It just says ""off."" Why not put a silver square next to the words? After all, there was plenty of room.<br /><br />Or, why not just say ""click the off button."" (Well, yes, it DOES seem counter-intuitive to click the off button to set the recording quality if you don't plan to turn the recorder off. Maybe they were trying to minimize confusion by using the square graphic instead?)<br /><br />The other directions are equally frustrating.<br /><br />For example, several start with""Hold info/menu for about 2 seconds and then release the button"" seems very odd. Am I supposed to sit here with a stopwatch, to make sure it's 2 seconds? What happens if I hold the button too long? (Rhetorical question. Nothing seems to change... it looks just as it did at 1 second and 2 seconds and so on.)<br /><br />Likewise, let's say I want to change the recording quality from Standard to High Play. Well, I'm supposed to hold that same info/menu button and release it.<br /><br />Then, I'm supposed to look for the word FOLDER flashing - and take as my cue to push the info/menu button ""repeatedly""... even though I'm not changing anything in the Folder. And then, I'm supposed to put the fast-forward lever OR the Volume button (apparently either one works equally well), and...<br /><br />Are you confused, yet? I was.<br /><br />I gave up and recorded something just to see if the Record button actually worked. On playback, it seemed to. So, I plugged the recorder into my Windows computer's USB drive. To RCA's credit, that is a convenient feature.<br /><br />I wanted to edit the sound files in Audacity. I've used that software for years because it works with almost any sound file.<br /><br />Within minutes, I learned that RCA's VOC files aren't standard, and - even with things like FFmpeg (which can recognize really unusual sound files) - absolutely nothing would recognize the RCA version of a VOC file. (Another one-star review mentioned this problem, as well, but I had to see for myself. He was right.)<br /><br />So, I'm glad RCA discontinued this recorder, but I'm unlikely to buy another RCA recording device. And if you're reading rave reviews for this product, check how old they are. Maybe the VOC files worked better, back then? (I tried this in Windows 7, and it didn't work there, either.)<br /><br />Save your money and avoid frustration. Even if you see one of these recorders for a super-low price, it's not worth it.",negative,positive
"I'm a retired IT professional and have used countless products including Apple for decades, so I've had the chance to experience good and bad products.  I typically do not have high expectations for inexpensive products made oversees.  However...this product has  by far exceeded my expectations.  I've had the product for over a year and it's pretty much been flawless.<br /><br />Pros<br />The device is very solid and well built.  Does not feel cheap at all.  Adding this to my iPad has for all practical purposes makes it feel like a laptop.  At times I forget it's an iPad.  I use my iPad in a variety of situations.  I still do consulting and I take it with me to meetings and conferences to take notes.  It's never failed me and works great.  I'm a musician and I use my iPads at gigs.  When I do that I have to take the iPad out of the case.  It's super easy to take the iPad in and out of the case.  This device is well designed.  I can't imagine Apple doing it better.<br /><br />The unit does a great job of protecting my iPad. I've dropped it a few times and seen no damage done to my iPad.  The case is holding up fine.  I am seeing some of the paint wear off on the edges.  Though I suppose that's a good thing because it means I've had the unit long enough for it to start wearing a bit.<br /><br />The keyboard works well considering it's a little small.  The backlight thing is cool, though I don't use it.<br /><br />Battery life has been very good.  I use the iPad almost every day and I rarely have to charge the keyboard. Maybe once or twice a month.<br /><br />I would buy this again and would recommend it to friends.<br /><br />Cons<br />The only thing I don't like about the keyboard is the placement of the right shift key. They put the navigation arrow keys in the bottom right corner of the keyboard.  To make that work they took space from the right shift key and made it half size and put the up arrow key on what was the left half of shift key.  I'm a touch typist so this means that I frequently hit the up arrow key instead of the shift key when I'm typing.  It's not a showstopper but it can get annoying at times and I have to be aware of it.  If you are a hunt-and-peck typist it shouldn't be a problem at all.",positive,positive

The best part of this bag has to be the DETACHABLE WATER RESISTANT RAIN-FLY that covers the entire backpack and tucks away in a zippered compartment when not in use. The back of this backpack is heavily padded with a breathable mesh lining which allows for ventilation while carrying the backpack. I would not hesitate to purchase this backpack, even if you don't need it to carry a laptop.  It is a great backpack to commute with!  It has everything you need and more!",positive,positive

"Pros: Easy setup, remote app control<br />Cons: Not as great of speed or range as other mesh systems, satellite antennas not as simple to place as other systems<br /><br />I found the Amplifi HD to be just /okay./ There's not really anything special about it that a better mesh system can't do. I thought this would be a good replacement for my Google WiFi router, but it proved to have less range and significantly less speed. You also have to place the satellite antennas significantly closer to the main router than any other mesh network I've tried. I've used Eero, Velop, Google WiFi, and Portal - and I have to say that AmpliFi has been my least favorite of the bunch. The main hub has a cool design, and the phone app is very easy to navigate. I'm looking forward to future versions of this product, but for now, I'm going to use an Asus Ai Mesh system instead.",neutral,positive

"The specs do not state it nor do the pictures on Amazon indicate it, but the unit I received has a USB type A female connector.. the same type as on the computer, so you need a double ended type A cable, which it does come with but are nearly impossible to find elsewhere. Means one more cable to keep track of.<br />Other than that, it is a reasonable inexpensive case, I had to add a small pad to the hard drive to keep it from rattling inside, but that is the norm with these cases unless the drive attaches to a sled with the bottom mounting holes.

"I've had my Drobo FS for a year. It is filled with five 2 TB drives and dual-disk redundancy turn ON.  It's about 40% full.  Our home network of six different computers (PC & Mac) easily connect to it.  Allowed me to consolidate all our videos (200 hrs) and photos (50K+) in one, secure place.<br /><br />PROS<br />1. Brilliantly simple.  Imagine what it would have taken in money and time to create such a robust situation only a few years ago.<br />2. Robust - I've lived through a hard disk failure with zero data loss.  Didn't even need to call anyone.  Just popped out the bad drive, waited two days for the replacement to arrive from Western Digital.  Popped it in and let it rebalance.  I was thankful that I had the dual disk redundancy activated.  Gave me some peace of mind while waiting on the new one.  Flawless performance.<br />3. Well engineered - impressive construction.  Simple-to-understand status indicator lights, magnetic easy-to-remove front panel access.<br /><br />CONS<br />1. Slow initial access.  When I open the shared volumes on one of our computers, it will hang, often for a matter of 5-20 seconds while the disks titter away.  Once the initial connection is made, then the transfer speeds are reasonable and snappy.  I'm assuming this is a result of the first four drives I purchased:  Western Digital 2 TB Caviar Green SATA.  They were cheap ($99 ea) but one already failed and they seem to be slow.  Going forward, I'm using Western Digital 2 TB Caviar *Black*.  I turned off the ""Disk Drive Spindown"" because someone mentioned that cycling power on drives wears them out prematurely and slows initial access.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I love the Drobo and hope it continues to perform as well as it has this first year.  Its importance in our lives was recently demonstrated when we prepared to evacuate our home in a face of an approaching forest fire.  Now that we've digitized all our family memories, we didn't worry about the photo albums or home movies.  We loaded the ""football"" in the car and were prepared to leave.  Thankfully, the fire dept beat the blaze, so we took 30 seconds and got it back online.  The next threat I'm considering is theft - this thing is very attractive and portable...",positive,positive

"For the money, these are nice buds. I ordered these looking for good bass, and they deliver...sort of. I had a pair of Klipsch S4's that were good until the cheap wires shorted out after maybe a year of normal to light usage. My favorites were a pair of Skullcandy Titans I found on the street several years ago. I left them in a computer at the library and they were gone when I went back maybe 10 minutes later. I digress. The bass, which is what they are known for, wasn't that great at first. I listen mostly to music on my cell phone for the convenience. My old Sansa had an equalizer built into it, but not so with the phone. But after I downloaded an equalizer app (Poweramp-thumbs up) the buds came alive. Without the control, they sound good, but not great. I'm not an audiophile, but I've had good speakers all my life (Klipsch Heresy's for over 30 years and Sennheiser headphones) so I think I know what music should sound like. I'm happy with them now, but glad I only paid $13 for them on that big auction site. If you want a REAL bargain, I found the Skullcandy 2XL buds on sale at Office Max for $5! I figured they would be crap, but they sound just about as good as these...no BS. For $5, they are AMAZING! These are a bit bulky, but comfortable enough. The wires are nice and thick and don't tangle. So, go ahead and get them but make sure you have an equalizer to get the most out of them.",positive,positive
"The title says most of it. I bought two of these almost two years ago, one for work and one for home. I primarily used them to connect a keyboard and mouse to a Lenovo Laptop. From day one I had problems with the hub seemingly going dead - the key board or mouse would just quit in mid-click. We had 6 of these Lenovos at work, and our, since we build USB devices we quickly discovered the Lenovos were slightly off the USB spec in several ways. This made me cut the hub some slack, even though my USB devices did work better when attached directly to the Lenovo.<br /><br />A few weeks ago the Lenovo died and I replaced it with an Asus. To my annoyance, both my hubs still go dead. I'm off to the store now to try some other brand.<br /><br />Except for the dying thing these hubs are not bad. The purple light is pretty with the silver finish, and the price was OK. The Power brick is quite weak - trying to charge my phone takes 3x longer on the hub than with the phone's charger. I would not try to run a USB hard drive through this hub.<br /><br />I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 because both hubs are still (almost) working after 2 years. That's better than a lot of cheap electronics these days.",neutral,negative

"Reviewing 2.1 amp 10 watt, 6-outlet version:<br /><br />Odd: when iPhone 6 in a case, and is plugged into one USB port, the Touch ID does not work. When it is plugged into the small OEM charger brick or iPad charger it works with case on or off, but not when plugged into this unit with the case on.<br /><br />BUT!<br />-- The Touch ID will start working when you plug in a second device. In this situation, both can be in cases.<br />-- The Touch ID will start working when plugged in with the case off and your hand/finger touching the metal back of the phone. (Yes, read that again.)<br />-- The Touch ID works when two devices are using both USB ports.<br /><br />According to Belkin, the unit sends 2.1 amps to one USB, and when 2 devices are plugged into the USBs it splits the power. My guess is plugging in one USB sends too much power to the iPhone 6 causing it to turn off the Touch ID? Know that this unit's USB port is 10 watts, the Apple small charger cube that comes with phones is 5 watts, and the iPad is 12 watts.<br /><br />Unplugging the devices allows the Touch ID to work again, and I never experienced the phones getting hot during charging.<br /><br />The regular power outlets work fine, and have good tight connections. I also found that the distance between the outlets worked well and did not cause the plug clashing you can experience on other devices.<br /><br />I my case, this unit is of no use to me since there are times only one USB device is plugged in and I like to use the Touch ID to log into the phone while plugged in.

"We installed the call blocker last night.  At first, it didn't work at all.  We installed it to a wired phone and followed the instructions.  Then, we read the additional suggestions to see if we could get it to work.  My husband spent about an hour with it and got it working....sort of.  It will block an incoming call when you hit the red button.  And, it will block programmed calls and area codes.  It isn't silent however.  It does give one ring with a blocked call or area code....I thought I had read that it didn't ring.  But, that was something I thought I could live with.<br /><br />Another feature that lists the number of  &#34;Blocked&#34;  calls on the screen is blank, so that also doesn't work.  I thought I could live with that too.  The device also doesn't allow me to see who's calling on my phone, but was displaying the Caller ID information on it's screen, so I thought that would be fine.  However, if I look at my phone, I can't tell anymore if I've missed any calls.  But, last night, I could hit the call button, and see the missed calls.<br /><br />Today, however, it took a turn for the worse.  Not only can't I see if I've missed any calls on my phone, I can't see the calls when I hit the Call List button on the Call Blocker.  I just get a bunch of random 3 and 4 digit numbers.  And, it is messing with our phone connections.  If another phone rings and is answered, I can't pick up another phone in the house and hear anything until the other phone is disconnected.  And, I'm getting dead spots in my phone conversations on other phones in the house.<br /><br />Also, in order to program the phone with numbers, or the other features, we have to hit the BIG RED BUTTON for about 15 seconds.  And, we have to do that with each item that we program.<br /><br />I could work with most of these issues.  However, losing my Caller ID function, on my phone and on the device is not acceptable.

"I had this GPS for 2 weeks so far:<br />This GPS is designed to be simple to use. It's fast to acquire its location and use is obvious enough to be very easy.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Voice is loud and clear. You can make your own voice set by downloading an application from Garmin. The application makes you say each voice component and creates a voice that you can upload to the 1390T.<br />- Better (than other GPSs I've seen) job at showing what's relevant on the map. On other units, it annoys to see half of a name of a street or not to see the names of the streets you are about to cross.<br />- Lane assist is great! It tells you on which lane you should be.<br />- Traffic info. This is free-ish. You may not pay for the feature with money but you will get adds that appear when the car is stopped. This adds are not very annoying, but I would prefer not to have them, yet somehow that service has to be paid for.<br /><br />Cons or things I would change:<br />- When selecting a place to go, it should not be necessary to hit a GO button again. If the user already selected the place to go, why the need to confirm?<br />- The Favorite places should also be accessible in the menu without going through Categories. It would be simpler.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />After using this GPS unit on foot, I saw that the battery is not big enough. It may work if you turn it on to know where you are, but not for keeping it on by it's own battery for ore than an hour. This limits the use for tourism.  This unit works very well in a car connected to the lighter outlet.",positive,positive
"So these are great, I built fake tombstones for outside to house a projector for Halloween and I used these to ventilate and cool the projector since it's enclosed.

"I use these with Arlo Pro cameras. I have five of them. I like the ""birdhouse"" casing with these mounts. It gives the camera some extra protection from the elements, and is inconspicuous. Since the actual mount connects to the casing with a standard threaded fitting, it can be used with any of the compatible mounts, and nothing has to connect to the camera. There is no adverse affect on the quality of video captured by the camera. The only downside of the housing that I have experienced is that it is difficult to remove the camera for charging without getting your fingers all over the lens. It sits down in there without much space around it for grabbing. One other possible downside is that rain hitting the housing will cause some noise. If you use audio detection then you could get some false-positives due to this.<br />The actual mounts that ship with these are terrible. They are impossible to finely adjust. You should be able to loosen the swivel, point the housing/camera where you want it, and then tighten it down. However, the swivel will never loosen to that extent. No matter how loose it is, you cannot adjust the direction over a full range, and you cannot tighten it all the way without turning the whole housing. When you tighten it, the camera and housing will move with it. Then you just have to force it back to aiming close to where you want it. Fine adjustment is impossible, but it is possible to get close to what you want with some extra effort.<br />A simple solution to this would be to buy the standard outdoor Arlo mounts, which work well, and connect the ""birdhouse"" housing directly to them. The threads are the same. I still think these are worthwhile even if you resort to that solution. I like the added protection and camouflage that they provide over mounting the camera alone, or even using the camera with a silicone skin.<br />These are good enough that, after trying one, I bought four more for other cameras. I have bought them from two different listings as different ""brands,"" but they are exactly alike. I recommend getting whichever ones are cheaper.",neutral,positive

"I have the high end i7, 8GB, 356GB SSD, HiRes display, Win 8.1. The overall design is good, keyboard works well, battery performance good (5+ hours in normal use.)<br />The recent design change integrating the left and right click buttons into the track pad is a huge mistake. I have already had Lenovo replace it once (the right click only worked when you banged it hard.) Now both work, but there is no positive feel to the click and I have to press it several times to get the desired effect. The recessed track point stick also isn't as good as the slightly proud version in previous models. BTW These problems are the same in the x240.<br />I cannot recommend the HiRes touch display. It looks sharp and the touch works well, but an awful lot of software out there doesn't work well with it. For example, Chrome simply won't scroll properly or accept accurate selections. Opera and Firefox both do work well (though they are really slow compared to Chrome.) With Sony Vegas, the fonts just don't scale right - way too small with dialog boxes that cover the OK button so you can't close them. Almost all Adobe software looks awful and performs poorly on this display. Note: these software work fine with normal res touchscreen displays.<br />Also, if you want to use a second monitor with the HiRes display you will have problems moving app windows between displays. Some scale correctly when moved to the lower res 2nd monitor, many do not.<br />Finally, think long and hard about buying the extended warranty from Lenovo. I have next day in-home service. Unfortunately, they never have the parts in stock. So, you end up waiting days (or weeks or months) for the part before you get &#34;next day&#34; repair service. I have a lot of experience with Lenovo service. I had a Thinkpad Twist which required multiple visits, and an x240 that was eventually returned. All required long waits for parts to show up.<br />As a longtime Thinkpad user I expected much more from the X1. This will likely be my last Thinkpad (after 15 years and 7 computers.)",neutral,positive

"While earbuds look cool and even stylish, the plastic cord is not so nice. Wood does provide clear sound, better than most earbuds, however noise isolation is next to non-existant. There is a choice of covers, in three different sizes, one set is silicone, cool translucent brown with red, and the other is quite the basic black rubber. I have tried all but the largest (too big for me) and none of them provided a really good comfortable fit. So most of the time there is a need to re-adjust them and that affects the sound quality. I give it three stars because of the clear crisp sound and nice look of the wooden buds, but I would definitely need a different pair for actual noise reduction.",neutral,positive

"I just installed these speakers today. They came packed in a nest of boxes in styrofoam and wrapped in nice scratch protecting bags. Unfortunately, the bags were a miscalculation on the part of the manufacturer. The bags have a hard plastic closure mechanism (pictured) and either during packing or transit this hard plastic bit shifted and ended up between a speaker edge and the styrofoam. This caused cracked dent and an additional dent on the right hand speaker (pictured). Neither the sound quality nor speaker itself seems otherwise damaged.<br /><br />I really don’t want a cracked dent on my speaker….but I also really don’t want to try to repack these things into all the boxes they came nested in, drive miles into town, drop the speakers off at the UPS store, and then wait weeks for replacements to cone… it’s hot out and I’m lazy.  So I’m not returning them…however, I’m pretty GD disappointed that for $500 I’d be put in a situation, because of the manufacturer’s packing fault, that would cause me to have to go through a huge amount of effort or live with a cracked brand new speaker.  I shouldn’t have to spend hours of my time and wait for days just to use a product I’ve already paid and waited for.<br /><br />The stupid thing is…these bags are essentially just dust covers. There is literally zero reason for them to have a draw string with a large hard plastic closure. It 100% defeats the purpose of the bag. So manufacturer, if you read this, please contact your packaging engineer and ask them to reconsider the method of closing those bags. A simple cloth drawstring without the hard plastic bit would serve just as well, save you money (because those closures are for sure not zero cost), and prevent damage to the product in transit.<br /><br />Because the damage is due to manufacturer’s original packaging, I can’t give this product the 5-stars I would have otherwise given it.  I’m going with 3-stars because they sound nice and work well, but the rage I feel over this stupid cracked dent makes me want to 1-star them, just so you’re aware.",neutral,negative

"Short review: It decreases screen quality by a lot.<br /><br />Long review: Even with smartphones and tablets, matte screen protectors severely decreases the quality of details in the screen. I thought this would be different based on the reviews of other Steam Deck users but I was disappointed. I just got used to the low quality display since I don’t have anything to compare it to, but when my wife’s Steam Deck arrived, it’s very noticeable comparing it side by side. She even told me how pixelated mine was and maybe I should RMA my Deck. I bought the same protector for her to have it handy for her Deck’s arrival but she declined because of the loss of quality.<br /><br />Other than the issue above, the package also has some major issues. The wet wipe they provide is dry, the microfiber leaves a lot of lint and the dust absorber sticks too much you can almost lift the Steam Deck when you try to get dust. I recommend that you double check the install kit before using it. Luckily I always had extra tools like this because of older screen protectors lying around.<br /><br />Not to mention that this is expensive and only gives you one protector. So if you mess up, you have to contact them and wait for another delivery. Other manufacturers include two.<br /><br />The pros, it definitely resists finger prints, glare has been reduced a lot, somewhat easy to clean.<br /><br />I wouldn’t recommend this product.",negative,positive

"I have had 2 Tom Tom-Go GPS units and have been reasonably happy with this brand. My first Tom Tom Go lasted less than a year at which point it lost its ""mind"" in the LL Bean parking lot, uttering, ""Turn, turn, turn."" The 2nd Tom Tom lasted 2 years when it suffered screen damage. When both units worked, they were reliable and paid for themselves many times over in gas savings.<br />  I decided to invest in the 1350 Nuvi refurbished Garmin to try out a new brand, to be reassured of having up-dated maps and to receive a 1-year warranty on this refurbished product whereas Tom Tom provides only a 6-month warranty on its refurbished GPS. I also liked the prospect of using the GPS for walking tours of NYC, Philadelphia, Boston, etc.<br />  My Garmin 1350 arrived quickly and in perfect condition. It could be used right out of the box.I was impressed by the sturdiness of the case and by how well the suction gripped the windshield. The unit seemed to turn on a bit more slowly than my Tom Toms but the route planning may be somewhat faster. I liked having the points of interest scroll down the screen. There appear to be many more POI choices on the Garmin than the Tom Tom. The categories are intuitive and it is helpful to quickly see both map location and contact information. Since my cell phone is paired with my car, I did not use to Blue Tooth feature to call up the store via the GPS unit, but this would be very helpful.<br />  I don't think that the default setting gives as much screen detail; e.g., providing names for all the streets. I have found the greater visual detail of the Tom Tom helpful when driving at night, but it is probably a needless distraction most of the time. It is very helpful to have the streets spoken at turns. The volume was perhaps even better than that of the Tom Tom. This surprised me, having read numerous complaints about Garmin being inaudible. I even had to turn down the volume to 80%. The pronunciations were reliably clear with only a few oddities; e.g., the town of St. Davids was spoken as ""Street Davids.""<br />  Route corrections were made more quickly than I experienced with Tom Tom and it is helpful to know which side of the street the destination is on.<br />  In making comparisons with the Tom Tom Go, there is a feature which I miss: the IQ routing. My Tom Toms had an uncanny knowledge of different routes and respective drive times at various times of the day. Quite fequently, the return route would differ from the original Also-- and more importantly-- the drive time was extremely accurate.<br />  In contrast Garmin seems clumsy and mechanical. Perhaps, this is because I am stil getting used to the Garmin? So far, I am extremely frustrated by Garmin's under-estimation of drive times. Even when I go 4 miles above the posted speed limits, I am seldom able to catch up with the predicted drive time.There seems to be no allowance for stopping at lights. The greater the distance, the more this discrepancy.This is surprising given the Garmin's close attention to changing speed limits.<br />  Also, I do not think that Garmin provides a warning about toll roads and the option to avoid them. I found this a very helpful Tom Tom feature.<br />  The option of adding a memory card to the Garmin provides increased flexibility. I am yet to download additional points of interest to the card from the various on-line web-sites which provide such information free. I also look forward to trying out pedestrian information for NYC, including (I hope) public transportation details. Had I known that Garmins with MP3 players are needed for auditory tours, I might have chosen such a model.<br />  A convenient feature is that the Garmin turns off automatically less than a minute after the car engine is stopped.The unit comes off the windshield readily for toting.<br />  While a manual is available at the Garmin web-site, the curious user will find various hints and tips on-line.<br />  I e-mailed 2 questions to Customer Service and received a helpful response within a couple of days-- even on a weekend!<br />  I am still exploring so have not firmed up my opinion as to which brand is the better choice. I am tilting toward Tom Tom because of the IQ routing, but then I would not want to give up the more detailed points of interest given on the Garmin.",positive,positive

"UPDATE: When I first reviewed this unit, I was watching video on my computer and letting the speaker system play the audio. However, now that I have set it up with my TV, I am noticing a few milliseconds of lag with the video.  If you are just playing music through this, it doesn't matter.  But when you are watching people talking in a movie, and the sound is delayed just a bit after the video, it can get annoying.  I even tried using the optical cable, but the delay was still present.  Even when I hooked this system up to my music keyboard, there was a slight delay using the aux in.  I now have it hooked up to my laptop for playing music while I use the computer and for watching YouTube videos, and it is fabulous for that.  The volume is impressive, and the bass is tight, accurate and controllable via the remote.  I have reduced my score to 3 stars.<br /><br />This system likes being pushed and sounds better at a decent volume.  This unit will fill a room with sound (specs say 320 watts). While listening to action movies, jazz, rock, and classical music, at no time did I hear distortion. Stereo separation is good on this unit.  The soundbar paired easily with both its subwoofer and my tablet.  The overall sound level is controllable via remote, and the amount of bass is separately controllable.  The selection of inputs is excellent, with HDMI, mini phone, optical, and bluetooth available.<br /><br />The 6.5&#34; ported subwoofer is impressive and tight, however only the lowest bass is shunted to this unit.  The rest of the sound is handled by the soundbar's 2.25&#34; speakers (2 per side) and 1.25&#34; dome tweeters.  The low mid-range is downplayed with this set up (it is difficult for 2&#34; speakers to accurately handle low mid-range) with the high end consequently being overly present.  This is not a problem with movies, but is not ideal for critical music listening (which, admittedly, few people do anymore).  I found the best listening was to acoustic guitar, fusion jazz, and classic rock and roll.<br /><br />Summary: good unit for casual listening to streaming music/mp3's, video on computer, etc.",neutral,positive

"I've had this unit for about a month now and I'm very happy with it's functionality.  It sounds great and has a lot of nice options.  I bought it to interface with my iPod and I couldn't be happier with the way it does.  I do always keep it in iPod control mode because it's always going to be easier to find a song on the iPod versus any CD player.  However, I just can't understand what Sony was thinking on a few aspects of this thing.<br /><br />First of all, as others have said, the display is ridiculously dim.  You can barely read the thing during the day even with the contrast turned all the way up.  My friend just had a $60 CD player installed and the display can easily be read at all times so there is no excuse for this $100+ unit to have an unreadable display.  I knew about this problem before I bought it and even though it's annoying, I would still buy it again because I do like the unit.  Now what really ticks me off is how easily my screen got scratched.  I go on my first GPS necessary trip with this thing (only 2 hours of driving) and arrive home to find a series of scratches on the screen.  What are they from?  The power cord on my GPS.  Yes, that nice smooth power cord scratched my screen to hell right where the time is displayed making it even harder to read in daylight hours.  Couldn't believe it.  Perhaps I could have been more careful, but c'mon, it should be able to take that.  God forbid I ever actually wanted to take my faceplate off and slipped it in my pocket or something.  I'd hate to see what would happen then.",neutral,positive

"Audio difference is extremely negligible. I would argue there is none, but without an upgraded sound card or audio receiver I can't be sure.  The cable is only a 1/6th as long as the stock cable with Kevlar casing. However, it fits in to a standard audio jack and is much more convenient than that crazy long cable. It shouldn't advertise as an upgrade cable. But it is nice and easy to use. I swap out the cables between the computer and for use with a FLAC player and amplifier.<br /><br />TL;DR: More convenient, but not an upgrade",positive,positive
So the sound is good considering how small the unit is itself..the volume can get quite loud..i love how compact it is..the only reason i gave it less than 5 stars is im still trying to figure out how to get it to sound without having to use the earbuds..it may not sound without them and i misunderstood but i hope it does and i figure it out..,positive,positive

Product is exactly what I needed now I can keep my IPOD charged and use the Aux input on my car without having to have two cables going to my IPOD.  Aux is so so much better than a FM input!  In addition to this product you will need a male/male aux input cable $6.99 at Radio Shack.  The Aux cable plugs into the cigarette adapter end of the Belkin product and then will need to be run or tied into your Aux input.  In my car the Aux input and charger plug are right next to each other so it was very easy!  Volume control on the Belkin product allows you to get the right input level to match other radio settings and avoid distortion.,positive,positive

"This is a belated review.  I actually bought this router 4.5 years ago. It was a Version 2.0. It was an awful first experience for a home wireless network.  Initial setup wasn't too difficult.  But, it would drop its wireless signal every few days and need to be completely reconfigured.  I spent numerous hours on the phone with Linksys Tech Support (India) over several weeks to get my network going again.  I finally gave up, but the return period had expired.<br /><br />After on-line research and word-of-mouth recommendations, I bought a Netgear WGR614.  It has just failed after 4.5 years and I have purchased the same Netgear model as a replacement.  It has never dropped its wireless signal.<br /><br />It is possible Linksys has improved this router over the years.  I know this is probably the most common router out there.  But, I would never consider one again.",negative,neutral

"UPDATE: the issue is in the SSD bottom part. Swap cables, swap SSDs and it is not reading. Since I’m in Brazil it took a while for me to be able to test it (Raspberry PI delayed the deliver about 5 months from UK). Hope the vendor is able to help me.<br /><br />So far a good product, well built, great case! But it is not working as expected. I’m still doing some tests but here it is what I’m facing: my SSD is not being read by the usb-usb adaptor that comes with the case.<br /><br />I bought this case even before I receive my Raspberry PI 4 8GB. Due to the worldwide delays, I got it about 15 days ago and I started doing some tests. Worked fine with SD card, boot and installed OS and when I was trying to boot from the SSD it was not appearing in the list of external drives to install the OS. I thought the issue was with the SSD, then replaced for another one that I new was working… no lucky. But when I attached from the external SSD case straight to the USB jack in the back, it was recognized. Now I’m waiting for the usb jumper I bought to see if the issue is in the base plate that comes with e Argo case or if it is in the usb adaptor. Hopefully it is the usb adaptor and I can use a small cable instead. I will update the review when I finish my tests.<br /><br />Overall impression is ok. Not sure if this is worth the price, but a nicely built case with lots of good sides. Seems I’m not lucky but, fingers crossed, I will overcome this issue.",neutral,positive
"(SECOND REVIEW) My first review was correct 100% but then after more time one headphone quote on quote ""collected moisture"" so it deemed the sound of one headphone even all the way up, it felt like the sound was at 35%. Good headphones TILL they get moisture in them. I didn't even really work out in them nor go in rain really so all i can say is good luck. I don't know for how long though. I tried to get them fixed but i really didn't want to pay for another pair then go through this so I'm gonna wait till the 3rd generation comes out or just pick up different wireless headphone's.<br /><br />(FIRST REVIEW) I absolutely love these.

I 100% recommend these cause there just amazing straight out the charging case instantly connects to my phone.",neutral,positive

"Earbuds Review:<br />I am an adult, with apparently small ears.  For reference, I can use the standard Apple earbuds (wired), but I struggle to find a good fit for wireless earbuds (generally they have something that inserts into the ear canal).  I thought I had a stroke of genius after trying yet another set of ear buds (Beats Pro) that fell out of my ears.  Try kid's earbuds!!  So, I found these.  They are highly rated, so I figured it was worth a try!  The only thing ""kid"" about these is the little silicone piece that goes into your ear.  The actual earbud is LARGER and heavier than a standard earbud.  And that us why I have concluded that these were made for the children of giants.",negative,positive

"[[VIDEOID:5b749e3895c1e29fa20105d93c11ebab]] I picked these up to have an alternative to my over-ear headphones while going to the gym. The over-ear HP’s would get sweaty and a bit uncomfortable while working out so I decided to check out something lighter. I got these in the mail and immediately I could tell the plastic housing wasn’t all that great if you want a set with that “premium” feel then this isn’t for you. My my needs (lightweight, comfortable HP’s) these fit the bill. Sound quality is decent but certainly not the best. Loud enough to not get distracted by the gyms own music. All in all it gets the job done. Certainly worth a buy if you need a spare set of HP’s to leave in your gym bag and certainly at a price you wouldn’t feel devastated if you lost them at any point.

"I'll start of by saying this is a very beautiful keyboard. The orange back-light looks awesome. The keys are spaced apart fairly well, though I have noticed myself hitting the U and I buttons together, and they fit the fingers comfortably. The font used for the keys is more of a gamer-like style, like the Razer Blackwidow, but unlike the blackwidow, this keyboard actually lights up the Shift-key options also.The keyboard is also a solid build; I am unable to bend it at all whatsoever. I can press as many buttons as my hands will allow, and the keyboard registers all of them.<br /><br />Now the bad, I will be returning this keyboard, even though I just unpackaged it about 20 minutes ago, because although it is a beautiful keyboard, most of the buttons don't click... at all. It would almost seems as though half of the keys are browns, which are supposed to have tactile feedback, but no click.<br /><br />Long story short, this is a gorgeous, well functioning keyboard that has been ruined by sub-par key switches.

"It's easy to scan the headset to any Bluetooth device. I use it to listen to movies on my tablet and not for phone calls.<br /><br />The sound is clear, picks up background sound and has a nice base to it. The volume and on/off switch are on the right ear cup. I find it easier to turn it on or off when not wearing them, but it's easy enough to feel along the rim and find the up or down volume control. The button to switch to phone calls may be a bit trickier because it's in the middle of the volume control.<br /><br />Although these are lightweight and don't get heavy while wearing, they do fit snug against the ear. I find I can only take about 90 minutes before my ears start to hurt. It would be better if they fit around the ear instead of on it.<br /><br />The ear cups can be turned to allow for  more compact storage and fit nicely in my bag with my tablet.<br /><br />It took 90 minutes to fully charge out of the box. So far I've only used them for two hours before charging again, so I'm not sure how long a charge lasts, or how long it takes to charge from a complete discharge. Just get in the habit of charging whenever you're not wearing them and you shouldn't have a problem.",positive,positive

"Many others have written extensive evaluations of this lens and I generally agree with the conclusions they have reached.  The point of my review is to state that the problems with the autofocus on this lens are not restricted to Canon cameras alone.  I have a new Sony ILCA-77M2 (successor to the SLT-A77V) and this lens has severe problems both finding and maintaining focus.  I should add that the Sony camera's chief claim to fame is its more advanced focusing system but that doesn't seem to matter with this lens.<br /><br />Fortunately, the manual focus system works very well and since the majority of my work with this lens with be with stationary objects this lens will be a very important addition to my lens arsenal.  That said, Tamron should never have let this lens out the door with the focusing problems it has.<br /><br />Like others, I would return this lens but Sony doesn't make a macro lens in this focal size so I'll have to learn to live with the shortcomings of this lens.  I sent Tamron a comment about the problem with this lens though I doubt I'll hear back from them.  If I do get a comment, I'll add it to this review.<br /><br />Tamron offered to fix my lens if they could find anything wrong.  Unfortunately since I bought the lens used, no warranty applies and they stated that the cost to fix might be in the area of $200 or possibly more.

"Purchased this July 15 2019 for my grandson. He hasn’t had it for 2 weeks yet, and already there is a port/charging issue. It will not hold a charge. I called amazon, spoke with 2 customer service reps, and 2 kindle tech supports. (Insert omg annoyance face here) after being on hold many times and over an hour later...a new one will be sent out. I was told that the old batch was sold out on amazon prime day and the new batch is in. Hope this one works! Buyer beware of charging issues, which result in not happy kids and really unhappy grandmothers!!",negative,positive
Easy to set up and app works great with my Android. Love being able to customize the controls and the phone app to my way of using it. Pleasantly pleased after a little customization it works great with my PS4. I need the PS4 controller to only turn it on. After that the Harmony controls do everything else. Only issue I have not solved. If I have a power outage the app stills thinks it is all on so takes a bit to get all the technologies aligned again.,positive,positive

"Keyboard is well-engineered and well-made. After initial charging, a month later the keyboard is still going without needing a recharge.

Requires one to watch what is being typed or deleted. As a result, I've reduced my rating from five to three stars.",neutral,negative
"The solar charging cell for my Ring camera works great. It was easy to install. The only modification we need was for it to face the sun at a slightly different angle so we bought an L-bracket at the hardware store and attached it to the base of the solar cell charger. Within a day my Ring camera showed a full charge. The solar cell worked great then and is still working great more than a year later. I wanted to see how a dark winter, cloudy days, change in the angle of the sun might affect my solar cell before writing a review. I can now say, works great without hesitation!",positive,positive
"I got this as a gift and I was so excited. I also got the Amazon recommended case for it and was extremely careful with it, but after only a week I began to notice fine cracks in the screen. So far they don't interfere with its use, but I'm afraid it will spiderweb sooner rather than later. I'm very disappointed that the screen cracked so easily. I've never dropped it even once and I make sure to close the case before setting it down, so no clue how the cracks happened.",negative,positive

"When it works, it seems to work OK.  But often, even when plugged in, it will just lose connection to your device or it will drop out midstream.  It's not very reliable.  You're better off looking for something else.<br /><br />I got this and it did work to see my old 3.5 IDE drives fine.... at least for a few minutes.  When I put it on my DVD 5.25"" drive from my old tower, it just couldn't power it.  And yes, I plugged it in and even just did it on its own.  The SATA interface would just lose connection to it every so often.  It just didn't feel like it was great quality.<br /><br />If you want to use a hard drive for your laptop, get something better than this.",negative,positive

"These are solid computer speakers for the price - much better than the built-in ones on my laptop.  The cord between the two speakers is only about 3' in length so they don't fully wrap around my monitors, but they are short enough to project the sound under the monitors when I have them set behind.  Really, my only main complaint is the annoying blue LEDs.  I have no idea why every single product now has to have lights, and when working in the dark hours of the late afternoon I find the lights annoying enough that I have to unplug the speakers.  They have a volume control dial on the cord, but it doesn't go all the way down to an ""off"" position to extinguish the lights, either, so I have to resort to plugging them in and out all the time.",neutral,negative

I am not happy with this laptop that is still pricey after being on sale because it's not quality enough for even sale price. It is heavy so If by accident it falls from a very short distance from my couch to the floor it broke off the back hinge part. This computer is very slow but has nothing to do with my internet connection. I like that it is touch screen but the clicking pad that I have no choice to use for things is very very hard to click and have it register. The main click not the right click on the computer broke and you have to keep re clicking it into place from being sunken in but is always going back to sinking in. I had to keep pressing very very hard for the clicker to work on this laptop and it raised my stress level so many times it's not worth it. This isn't a computer that you should buy If you need it all day mostly during the week for work. I can't even shop online right now because the page just won't load for Walmart. This has happened several times with this computer and after restarting a few times and typing into google it just wouldn't show me the site for some reason. This computer is not the least bit advanced for any simple thing without there being some kind of problem. This HP laptop has crashed on me soooo many times I can't even count. This makes it so hard to do work on and is so stressful and frustrating and not trustworthy the least bit. A waste of money... I can't wait to get a laptop that isn't HP. The only cool feature is touch screen. The battery life isn't the greatest either I always need it plugged in. So if you wan't a computer that you can trust and have it function well without it falling apart so easily take your money somewhere else.,negative,negative
"It's okay. I've had the tablet for three days and the it came with a dead pixel and some ghosting around the edges, which is annoying when looking at a screen with dark images. However, the worst part is it's wifi antenna. I have very good wifi and all of my other devices run fast on the wifi, however this tablet is very slow when browsing the internet or doing anything that requires internet, especially video. Also, the standard amazon apps hang, glitch, and close for no reason. The only reason i put three stars is because it was $35 for Black Friday.

"Good value for secondary and/or backup use. They are cheap knock-offs of the high quality batteries that Sony sells. These work on Sony products, but are not the same quality as the original Sony batteries.  I am surprised Amazon  lets the seller say they are sold by Sony when they are actually 3rd party knock-offs.<br /><br />I use these batteries in my LED photo lighting units and they are great. However, I would not use them in my camera--I'd use the best, long-lasting Sony original batteries for that. The original Sony batteries cost far more and are far better than these cheaper versions. So, it depends on how you are going to use the cheaper batteries. They are very good for some things.",neutral,positive

"I hate that these are discontinued because the price has increased so much. I love giving these type cameras to my daughter (age 3) when we go to the beach or pool so she can take photos. These disposable cameras are very hard to harm and they're the only type I trust her with!<br /><br />Unfortunately there's no flash so unless you have a ton of light, the quality will not be very good. Very dark and grainy. I have used both these and the Fujifilm waterproof ones and while I got more photos from Kodak (the place I get them developed tosses all the photos which turn out just black or grey) the Fujifilm ones were clearer. Out of 27 exposures I usually get 14 or less pictures I can actually see. The rest are all black or all grey. Same with Fujifilm. I've gotten my film back before where only 8 pictures turned out. Out of 27!<br /><br />If you have a phone that takes photos, I suggest getting a dry bag or waterproof case so you can take photos with your phone.",neutral,negative

"Now using with an updated Apple iPhone (12 Mini). They seem to work much better and are more stable than with the 6s. Things to note:  Alexa is unable to respond to requests to turn on devices in the house, etc., while on a phone call; sound for music is fine; they are more comfortable in the ear than the Apple Airpods.  I like that you can mute calls with a long press on one (or both) of the ear buds.  I also like that the case stands on its own. I still prefer the Apple Airpods for using with an iPhone just because of the seamless Apple integration, especially with Apple Watch.  All in all, echo buds 2 are not a bad alternative to the Apple Airpods if using with an iPhone.",neutral,positive

"I bought these headphones March 21, 2103 and they worked perfectly up until June 2015 when they just suddenly died in the middle of a song. I tried charging them back up thinking they had just died without sounding the warning beep (the sound made prior to the battery going dead) but they wouldn't take a charge even when plugged in for 24 hours. The red light stayed on and never went off. Tried doing the factory re-boot but that didn't help either. They were just dead and wouldn't turn back on. On a whim I Googled the company and found a contact number. I had a person answer in just a few rings and I was able to find my original order in my Amazon purchases and give him the purchase number. He verified my address and said he would ship me a new pair. This is by far some of the BEST customer service I have ever experienced. Within two days they had me a brand new pair of headphones in my mailbox. This is the way customer service is supposed to be. Thank you Kinivo for making a great product and standing behind it. I use these headphones while vacuuming, washing the car, yard work, BBQ, etc.... They are fantastic headphones.",positive,positive

"Pre-installed game will ruin your life or at least use of the Surface Pro 3.<br /><br />It's called &#34;Where in the World is my F###ing Surface Pen?&#34; and you will play it several times a day; it's that addictive.<br /><br />Perhaps you've heard of shortcuts to keep the stylus in place but none of them are truly robust enough to keep the pen attached in-and-out of your attache, backpack or whatever.  Truly, your workaround will just increase the uncertainty in exactly where the pen could have come separated.  In normal mode, at least you can think of the last place where you actually used the pen but that's not the case if it separated without you knowing.<br /><br />You will play this game, daily and with religious fervor, until you bench the Surface Pro for a less capable but less infuriating bit of gear (Samsung Note Pro 12.2 or equiv).",negative,positive

I needed an external drive enclosure for my home computer and there really isnt many options out there. The price of this is pretty high since the led power indicator is held in place with hot glue. The issue I have is that the wires connected to the LED was actually loose as the hot glue wasn't even glued to the case.  for the price i would think this wouldn't be an issue.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. The thing works.<br />2. turns off when the system turns off. This was a nice touch.<br />3. Does have rubber feet when place on its sides. Seen others say it doesnt have.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. the glue not actually being stuck to the case.<br />2. no rubber feet to install vertically.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />The overall build quality is good would have given 5 stars if there was and issue with the build quality.<br /><br />I would buy another if i was in need of one.,neutral,positive

Target Display Mode is not supported in Mojave, Catalina or Big Sur.  See HT204592 on their support site.

"...said the Best Buy sales woman to me as I was paying for this TV who then proceeded to explain how I'll need these new 4k cables to get the most out of my new 4k TV.  All &#34;High Speed&#34; HDMI cables are 4k etc. capable.  Don't buy into the hype.  I'm upgrading from a 2005 42&#34; Sony KDE-42XS955.  My old plasma has incredible speakers.  Clean sound, deep bass, LOUD (very loud).  I have decided to upgrade due to deteriorating visuals and to bring myself into the 4k crowd.  The display is night and day from my old TV.<br /><br />I'm using this TV with Fosmon braided high speed HDMI cables, PS4, Xbox One S, Wii U and 2012 Mac Mini.  My experience has been mixed but mostly positive.  I'm going to separate this review into 3 sections: The TV itself, the remote and the smart functionality.<br /><br />TV Pros:<br /> - The body of the TV is beautiful.  The bezels are so slim and the TV has so little depth, I was shocked when I pulled it out of the box because of how thin and light this is.  My old plasma is so deep and SOOOOO heavy (120-140 pounds depending on where you look), it was absolutely shocking to find that this TV is around 30 pounds.<br /> - The display is gorgeous.  The way I set it up was:<br />1. Switched to my Mac Mini and adjusted the pictured settings until I was satisfied.<br />2. Switched to my PS4/Metal Gear Solid V then further adjusted the settings until I was satisfied.<br />3. Switched to my Xbox One S/Forza Horizon 3 but started with the Xbox One display calibration then I went into Forza to make some final minor adjustments.  All of my gaming and videos look perfect now.  4k and HDR gaming is incredible.  Seeing the clarity and sharpness with this TV shows me just now ugly the display of my old plasma really is.  I thought it was bad but had no idea it was that bad.<br /> - Zero lag.<br /> - 4 HDMI ports.  This is mind-blowing because my old plasma had 1 HDMI port...  I've had to fuss around with HDMI switches for so many years...this is amazing.<br /> - Great UI.  It has some issues once in a while but it's rare enough to not be a nuisance.  It pretty much only happens when I try to get into some menu too soon after I turn it on.<br /> - No annoying &#34;always on&#34; lights on the bezel.  Settings in the TV allow you disable the white light underneath the screen.  My old plasma had a small red light when the TV was off and a small green light when it was on and neither could be disabled.  I have this TV set to only flash the white light when I press a button on the remote.<br /> -Zero light bleed noticed while playing video games.<br /><br />TV Cons:<br /> - Light bleeding mainly on the bottom right corner that is visible when using my computer (my TV is my monitor) and when watching Youtube.<br /> - Too short of a cable from the power port on the TV to the power brick.  My old plasma had something like 6 feet of power cable.<br /> - Blacks aren't as deep as I expected.  Adjusting brightness and contrast doesn't change this.  Changing the blackness settings helps but messes up other things so I'll make do with it as is.<br /><br />Remote Pros:<br /> - Nice rubberized finish to the top side.  I love how it feels.<br /> - Microphone button on the top.<br /><br />Remote cons:<br /> - Tiny play/pause etc buttons on the bottom of the remote that are hard to find and harder to figure out the right one.  PLAY, PAUSE and the arrows should have been LARGE and well centered.<br /> - Terrible button layout overall.  It has a dedicated &#34;Google Play button&#34; which was a lousy decision considering no one uses it.  It should have been made a general streaming button that can be changed to whatever I want because I'd have it as Youtube and the other as Netflix since that's what I use.<br /> - When using the Youtube app, a lot of buttons just don't respond due to being blocked for whatever reason (such as microphone a lot of times).<br /> - Sometimes the remote just won't respond.<br /> - No dedicated settings menu.  Only an &#34;Action Menu&#34; which brings up some settings.  In order to bring up the settings, I have to use the microphone.<br /> - The ENTIRE back of the remote has to be popped off  in order to change the AAA batteries (AAA...).  I feel like this was an aesthetic move but it sure is irritating.  You press a button on the bottom then have to pry off the back with an uncomfortable amount of pressure.<br /><br />Smart Pros:<br /> - The apps just work.  I have heard so many horror stories about how lousy TV apps are but I've had great experiences with mine.<br /> - Internet connection is SOLID and stays connected with zero hiccups.<br /> - The microphone understands me well and works quickly.  It works as I'd expect it to, being an iPhone user with Siri.<br /><br />Smart Neutral:<br />When turning on the TV, it takes a few seconds for the wifi to initialize.  This makes Youtube and Crackle not show in the discover menu until several seconds when the TV realizes it's online and that these apps need wifi.  For some reason, Netflix is ALWAYS on the discover menu regardless if the others are there during this brief period.<br /><br />Smart Cons:<br />None so far.",neutral,positive

"This is small but I only need it to photograph my greeting cards & a close up on the charms. It very bright and shows dust on the velvet display. But shows off the charms very well! But the problem is photographing my photos, they have a high glass and the led lights reflect on my prints.

"I did a lot of research and bought this because of the high very recent reviews it got for streaming and gaming, reviews that came out in the last couple months, like from Consumer's Report and PC-World, consistently appearing in the top 5, never top 1 or 2, though because those cost around $500 instead of $200.<br /><br />ANYWAY, those reviews apparently didn't address how CRAZY DIFFICULT it is to set up this router and get it working. I'm fairly tech savvy, but I wasn't expecting that I'd need that since every router I've ever used before was just plug in and go. NOT THIS!<br /><br />Instructions- there are none! All you get is a small that card doesn't give you any actual instructions, just a ""quick start"" method that DID NOT WORK, a ""trouble shoring section"" consisting of less than 50 words over two bullet points, and three ""support"" netgear.com web addresses. Also, that ""quick start"" method isn't instructions on how to set it up but just how to use your smartphone to download an app that controls it.<br /><br />So, I used my phone to go to Netgear's website to see if it had instructions. Nope. So, I did what I've always done to install a router. I unplugged the old one and plugged in the new one, but NO INTERNET. I could network to my other devices on my network, but they all showed NO INTERNET ACCESS. When that three-step ""quick start"" method for downloading the Nighthawk app to my phone failed to provide any resolution to the problem, I used my phone and went to those so-called ""tech support"" addresses, all three of them.<br /><br />THE THREE ""TECH SUPPORT"" SITES AT THE ADDRESSES PROVIDED ARE A JOKE! They give you NOTHING. They allow you to type your router's model number in, but that doesn't send you to any instructions or anything, no. It just sends you to a page where you can search questions asked and answered by other users, UTTERLY USELESS because its search engine is so bad that finding anything relevant is nigh unto impossible and because, after reading a few, I could see it was just the blind leading the blind, oh, and that page does offer links to two YouTube videos, which I thought might give me visual instruction, but NO. They were also IRRELEVANT and USELESS, one of them not even this router. There is NO LINK TO ANY ONLINE TECHSUPPORT FROM NETGEAR NOR TO BE ABLE TO CHAT WITH ANYONE AT NETGEAR. There IS a button you can click at the bottom in the event you can't find what you're looking for and need additional help, but clicking it takes you RIGHT BACK TO THAT FIRST PAGE that asks you to enter the model number, and when you do, it takes you RIGHT BACK TO THAT PAGE YOU JUST LEFT with the two useless YouTube video links and useless, unsearchable, blind-leading-the-blind user Q&As-- oh, AND a button at the bottom to click if your question or problem hasn't been resolved, so hope after all! Nope. When it comes to Netgear, hope is just undiscovered disappointment. That's because when you click it, it just takes you back to the page that brought you to this useless page, asking you again to input your modem's model number, at which point it promptly brings you right back to this same useless page where you can again hit the button at the bottom for if your question or problem hasn't been resolved to have Netgear run you in circles forever.<br /><br />SO... as I have a friend who's 23 and owns a computer repair shop and does very well as he's a genius with this kind of stuff, setting up networks for people and businesses all the time. He's literally the #1 computer guy in my town. So I called him. And good friend that he is, he came right over.<br /><br />AND IT TOOK HIM OVER AN HOUR TO GET IT WORKING. He said it was the most difficult router setup he's ever seen EVER! He started doing the exact things I did exactly the way I did them. It didn't work. He also did other things I tried, like power cycling the network and all its devices, disconnecting the modem and reconnecting it. He then found instructions for manually installing it using the router web interface from Netgear, which was extremely laborious, requiring one to look up and key in the IP address, DNS server, alternate DNS server, subnet mask, router IP address, etc., etc. And after all that, that also failed to work. Yes, after identifying the network and typing in the password, network devices could connect to each other through the router, but NO INTERNET! It was only after he found a way to access the bios of the router itself and then got information that he then found a way to input through his smart phone through Netgear's registration page that the internet finally started working, but only for the wireless devices. The hard-wired devices, two PCs hooked directly to the router with ethernet cables, required some additional finagling to get them to have internet access too.<br /><br />Now that it's all up and running, it work's GREAT!!! The Wi-fi 6 is awesome. I'm able to have two PCs and a laptop on the Internet, have three smart TVs streaming, and have several cell phones and tablets all on my network without a single hiccup. It really does do what all those great reviews say.<br /><br />HOWEVER, IT SHOULD NOT BE SO DIFFICULT TO INSTALL AND SETUP. THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR IT! AND SINCE IT IS, THERE'S ALSO NO EXCUSE FOR THERE BEING ZERO INSTRUCTIONS OR SUPPORT FROM NETGEAR.<br /><br />I'm computer savvy. I'm actually a site LAN coordiantor and areas systems coordinator at my work. So I'm no slough. But I couldn't do it. And the smartest computer guy I know, it took him over an hour of highly technical monkeying to get this router, the Netgear Nighthawk 6-Stream AX5400 WiFi 6 Router (RAX50) - AX5400, up and running, to get it to access the Internet.<br /><br />NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO CALL IN A PROFESSIONAL TO SIMPLY INSTALL AND SETUP A HOME NETWORK ROUTER, ESPECIALLY NOT ANYONE AS TECH SAVVY AS ME, BUT I DID HAVE TO. AND IF HE HADN'T BEEN MY FRIEND AND CHARGED ME WHAT HE CHARGES, THE TIME IT TOOK HIM, IT WOULD HAVE COST ME AROUND $150, ALMOST AS MUCH AS THE ROUTER ITSELF.<br /><br />And it's ALL Netgear's fault. They've made this router extraordinarily difficult to install. Then made matters worse by providing literally no instructions at all. Then made matters worse again by providing an absolutely useless trouble-shooting guide that is less than 50 words total and only has two bullet points. And then made it again even worse still by providing no actual tech support at all, either, but instead leading customers on that they do when they don't actually, because when you go to it, there's nothing there in the way of support.<br /><br />LONG STORY SHORT:<br /><br />GREAT ROUTER ONCE YOU GET IT UP AND RUNNING, BUT NETGEAR HAS MADE GETTING IT TO THAT POINT AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE, A NIGHTMARE SO BAD YOU NEED TO CALL A PROFESSIONAL, FOR WHOM IT WILL ALSO BE A NIGHMARE.",neutral,negative

"These are good at what they do; with one semi major exception.  They are comfortable, they sound good, the battery life is great.

I've had to delete and re-pair them a half dozen times because they seem to get confused moving between devices (macbook, pixel XL and Nvidia Shield TV).<br /><br />The other annoying thing is that they occasionally studded or drop out for no good reason;  like phone 3 feet away inside a room with direct LoS to my head.

"I have 10 UPS spread around my home for various bits of essential kit (my needs are a bit beyond the norm), and this little guy has found a home with our modem being it's sole responsibility.  Given the extremely modest power draw of the modem, this lasts 30+ minutes.  600VA / 360W won't go far for most PCs.  It could do for a Mac Mini or similar PC with laptop based internals or a laptop (which tend to not need a UPS with their internal batteries serving that purpose), but I didn't try this.  I didn't due to my 9 other units and the fact that this unit doesn't clearly state it's output waveform (pure sine wave, simulated sine wave, stepped wave, etc...).  Absent that I'd recommend this be used with various low power appliances like modems, routers, inkjet printers (not sure why they'd need to be available in a power outage), DVR, etc...  I'd recommend a POE switch, but those can chew through 600VA fast.<br /><br />The price is still sound given those uses, but I'd only recommend buying this for non-PC uses given the limited power and uncertain AC output on battery.",positive,positive

"I already own the original Octopad, which fits my Nikon D5300 with most of my lenses easily. My main shooter is a Nikon D500, though, which is just too large and heavy for it.<br /><br />I have included photos to show how the Octopad XL compares to the original. It’s significantly larger and heavier. The added weight is important if your equipment is heavy like mine is. Obviously, you will feel that added weight if you’re carrying the Octopad around though, so if your equipment doesn’t require the XL, you may want to stick with the smaller version.<br /><br />Both products have a vinyl bottom that “grips” whatever it’s placed on. It grips really well. It doesn’t feel sticky though. Note that it’s really important to keep that bottom clean in order to keep that gripping quality.<br /><br />The fabric on this is heavy duty. It is filled with something that feels like sand. It’s sealed completely, so whatever it is filled with isn’t going anywhere.<br /><br />Both versions have a Velcro’s tap that can be used to tuck any cords out of the way. The smaller version also has a tab with a grommet. The paper insert for the XL shows that grommet as well, but they obviously eliminated it at some point. It’s a shame. I like having the option of clipping it with a carabiner to make it easier to carry it around.<br /><br />The mount for this product works, but it seems like there should be an easier way. The bottom of the mount screws into the Octopad. The camera screws into the top of the mount. Annoyingly, both ends screw in in the opposite direction. That means that you have to screw in one end, then either carefully spin the camera, or spin the Octopad in order to secure the camera to the mount. I had to keep moving my camera strap as it was cooling around the Octopad mount as I spun the camera. A quick release mount for the camera would have fixed that problem.<br /><br />The ball head on the mount holds somewhat securely. I say somewhat because as I moved my camera around, it became a bit loose. With that in mind, it’s a good idea to keep checking and tightening the screw on the ball head.<br /><br />Overall I really like the Octopad. I like having the option of being able to use a longer shutter speed without having to drag around a tripod. I am really happy with the XL model, as I feel that my heavy camera outfitted with both a lens a large speed light are secure on this product. I would recommend this highly.<br /><br />I hope this review has been helpful to you!",positive,positive

"First and foremost: the battery on this lasts only a couple hours, so when it says ""portable"" it's a bit misleading. Yes, technically, you can play music while moving it, but you're probably going to want do leave it plugged in 24x7 (or maybe 22x7); you're really not getting much portability out of it.<br /><br />Second, most of the music services it pairs with will give you only extremely-limited functionality unless you've signed up for the *paid* versions of those other apps, so keep your expectations limited. Third, the ""Alexa"" is sometimes turned on and sometimes not. I can't for the life of me figure out what the pattern is. I normally just use my phone because I can't rely on this speaker. Fourth, sometimes the Bose app simply can't find the speaker at all, even after multiple reboots (of both phone and app). I can't figure out why, so usually just pair it directly to my phone via Bluetooth and ditch the app completely.<br /><br />The sound quality? Yeah, it's good, but you're not getting much out of this device that you can't get from a much-cheaper Bluetooth speaker, so I'd go that route instead.

"This does the job and is much easier to set up for multiple bluetooth-sending devices than the little pocket Nokia receiver that I bought at about the same time.<br /><br />It does need to be plugged into the wall during use, so you can't use it on the go.<br /><br />It doesn't work with my old stereo with the white and red audio input cables: I could connect it, but it only transmitted noise. This isn't a problem with the stereo, because I have various other devices connected to it through these cables.<br /><br />With my newer speaker dock, it works well most of the time. For some reason, most tracks play well, but for a few (streamed through my computer), the sound suddenly deteriorates and I get a lot of noise. I'm not sure why this should be, as it is always a whole track rather than part of one. If I shift the sound output to my computer speakers (not using the Belkin device), they play fine. If I leave the device and speakers connected and skip to the next track, that plays fine, too. So it's a mystery to me: perhaps something to do with how different tracks are encoded.<br /><br />As other reviewers have said, the sound quality is certainly nothing to shout about even when it is working well.",negative,positive
"This device is much better than any of the other harmony remotes i have owned! The biggest issue i have had with others is that when you dont touch the remotes with enough delecacy they get reset and then you jsut have to do everything manually. The also always have issues not quite turning on or off all of the devices they are supposed to. With this one, both of those issues are a non-issue because the device itself is stored away in a cabinet, and the RF transmitter can be put anywhere and just bounce the signal around the room until it does what it is supposed to. Furthyermore the &#34;Basic Remote&#34; it comes with is super nice and significantly sturdier than other harmony smart models.<br />The reason i only gave it 4 rather than 5 stars is because i basically only use the basic remote because thwe app on the smartphones and iPad are terrible. Not only are their interfaces (i have used it on android, iPhone and iPad) just terribly designed and super un-intuitive to navigate, they also limit many basic functions that even the basic remote as, and the bigges issue is the delay. You swipe up, or tap the button up to move or change the channel and the delay is a good 2 seconds or more!<br />Basically how it works is you can put the &#34;Smart Hub&#34; somewhere either out of sight in a cabinet, or you can display it if you want, then you plug in the RF transmitter which is a little dongle on a 6ft cable. I am unsure whether you can use the smarthub without the RF transmitter, and you may be able to if you dont have it in a cabinet, but i do so it doesnt work without the dongle. Then you set up the app on your smart device, which is actually pretty difficult to set up. I did transfer over my activities and info from an old remote, but the setup still has you go through some steps to make sure it is all working properly. Then you can either use your device to make your commands or the remote is comes with. The RF transmitter will bounce the signal around your room so it really doesnt need to be placed very stratigically, but the type of room you are in may affect this. There was one spot i initially placed mine and it would turn on everything but my TV (i really think it was more because my TV has a weak reciever) but then i moved it a few inches and that did the trick, plus everywhere else i messed around with putting it except for the one spot worked fine.<br />Another added bonus is that it has bluetooth, and though it has told me that it doesnt work for the PS4 (Yet?) it does woprk with the PS3, and the one that i was happy about it that it lets you use the keayboard feature for the Apple TV so you dont have to &#34;type&#34; with the joystick navigation.<br />I would highly recommend this device to anyone, and though it has a few quirks i think it may be one of the best Harmony devices, plus its a bit cool to show your friends that you can control everything with just your smartphone!",positive,positive

"I was concerned the arm would not be sturdy enough but I found it is very sturdy. I have had my cams pointing at a birds nest.  There has been substantial wind and the parent birds and the fledglings as well have found the arm (pictured)  a good place to perch.  In the nearly two months the clamp has held my cams they have not moved. I was pleased to find the clamps open very wide and have material on the inside that seem to keep the clamp from scratching up or sliding off the  surface of the object it is clamped onto.  These clamps and bending arms have given me the opportunity to use my Blink minis to have a front row seat to all of the nest activity.  There is nothing to adhere the camera to that would not be invasive to the nesting  birds or damaging to the stucco wall of the apartment building.  The clamp and arm gave al<br />me an unobtrusive and closer view.  Lastly since this is an apartment drilling holes was not something I could do to mount my ""bird cams,"" but the clamps give a sturdy hold and I am easily and quickly to move the camera view either by changing to position of the arm or clamping it elsewhere. I  don't write tons of reviews but this has been an awesome purchase that  I  am glad I made!  Lastly I included a pic of the fledglings in their nest which is what my cam in the clamp is pointed at.",positive,positive

"I have to preface this by saying that there is a high probability that the unit I received was defective, and that I have since returned it. Considering that I was a bit skeptical of buying a third party teleconverter (instead of sticking with Canon) in the first place, my very brief encounter with this product left a sufficiently bad taste in my mouth that I simply returned it without ordering a replacement.<br /><br />I ordered this teleconverter primarily for occasional use with a Canon 6D and, specifically, the Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6L IS. That particular lens does not work (well) with Canon's teleconverters, but I had read a number of success stories of people using it with the Kenko 1.4x TC. I don't especially need the extra reach, but I was curious enough to give it a try. I was aware that there was a possibility of losing autofocus (though, again, a number of people online have claimed that AF continues to work, though a bit slower, with this lens. I had no such luck.<br /><br />Initial impressions: The Kenko 1.4x Pro 300 DGX seems solidly built. It's heavier than I'd expected, but it conveyed a sense of quality. I was impressed with it, physically. Mounting it to the lens and the camera body was simple enough. But that's where things went south.<br /><br />Problems: When combined with the 6D and the 70-300L, autofocus completely stopped working. I was able to manually focus, half-press the shutter button and still get the focus confirmation beep, but the autofocus wouldn't work. As I said, I knew this was a possibility, but I'd heard enough success stories that I was disappointed. More troubling, however, was that the camera's image stabilization also ceased to function. I had read NO accounts of that being the case, which I was I believe my unit may have been defective. I could deal with manual focus, perhaps, as long as I still had that lens's magnificent IS on tap. But no dice.<br /><br />I tried the teleconverter with the Canon 24-105 f/4L IS and the Canon 50 f/1.8, and it was the same thing. No autofocus and no IS, in the case of the former. I tried removing and reinserting the battery, as some had claimed makes a difference. In my case, it did not.<br /><br />My inclination would be to give the product one star, but as I said, the build quality seemed impressive. However, if mine was in fact defective, they may have a quality control issue. If it was not defective, then it's essentially useless, in my opinion.<br /><br />In the end, I'm not that upset that this product was a bust. As soon as I mounted it on the lens, part of my brain was asking, ""What are you doing? This is going to compromise the performance of the lens... and honestly, given how much of an inconvenience it is to mount it in the first place, how often do you think you'll use it, anyway?"" It's not hard to mount, but it's certainly more inconvenient than simply mounting a lens on a body. And given the fact that any TC will degrade image quality to varying degrees, I realized it's just not worth it to me. Your mileage may vary.",negative,negative

"I read a dozen reviews of this lens before I bought it and literally thought I'd get Leica performance at a third of the price... Well, that didn't happen.  There's a red color shift to the left side of the pictures that is rather irritating(as well as some other color issues with reds and greens). Unfortunately the reviews of I read failed to mention this.  It can be corrected with software or by just shooting in B&W, but my other lenses have not had this problem.  FWIW, I've only used it on an EOS M.  Turns out, lots of folks have the same problem with this lens on various cameras and it's not just my example.<br /><br />That said, this lens is crazy sharp and makes for great B&Ws.  I can't decide if I want to return it.  Forcing myself to shoot B&W is educational.<br /><br />update: I've got to use this on a Leica M and I've got to say that the color issue is not nearly as pronounced.  However, it is difficult to actually attach the lens to the camera compared to the Leica lenses I tried.  Ugh!  I really wanted to like this lens b/c the detail/sharpness are utterly awesome, but I can't say that I do.  It does have great potential and maybe this is just a poor example, but I would want to force this lens on to a $7,000 camera very often(well, never to be honest).  Bummer.",neutral,negative

"If only this 7th generation Nano would play a complete playlist, but it randomly skips and goes on to another track from somewhere else.  Very strange. (That doesn't bode well for a planned playlist intended for a party!)  Also, the new sync cable is different--it has a tiny plug at the opposite end of the USB attachment instead of the old 1"" plug, so if you want to play it on a separate stereo device, you need to buy a special adapter for that. Also, sometimes the pause feature doesn't work so the Nano just keeps on playing.<br /><br />Maybe this is just one exceptionally defective device, but I regret ordering it now.

When you first get this item and open it up you get the impression that it was a great deal and it looks great because it is made out of metal.

"Well, this DID improve WiFi connectivity speed averaging 50-100% (at least for me). Using laptop onboard WiFi (which is ""ac"" compatible) was lucky if I could get 20-30 Mbps.

"Parts appear to be missing.  The trays that go into the drive bay which hold onto the drives looks to be missing for my case. I'm trying to work around it while also trying to get the trays without having to send back the case.  Wish me luck.<br /><br />Update 7/22/2015: Within six days I got the missing trays from Logisys which had great service (from oscar at elogisys.com).<br /><br />The case is on four little feet which is nice except that the case wobbles, so that is not the greatest quality.  I needed more SATA power connectors (only came with two) so I also ordered Syba SY-CAB40007 Molex 4 Pin to 2x 15 Pin SATA Power Cable from Amazon and that met my needs. The case has no manual or bill-of-materials to tell one what all should come with it (or at least I didn't get one), so it took some head scratching until I realized I was missing the trays which explained why the bays wouldn't hold my drives. Fits one optical drive, three desktop drives (3.5&#34;) and two laptop size drives (2.5&#34;).  The 3.5&#34; and 2.5&#34; drives are arranged somewhat strangely (no nice rows or in one place) but are all easily accessible. The very top bay is really a cable run but in a pinch one could probably put a 2.5&#34; drive in there.<br /><br />As an inexpensive case to house miscellaneous pieces of PC gear forming a working PC, it was a great deal.<br /><br />Update 2/18/2018 - 2.5 years later: The power supply has started to make noise and enough vibration that it rattles the table it sits on.  There is no warranty information on the elogisys dot com site, so I sent an e-mail back to my original contact at mentioned above.

"I've had these for, I think, 2 years now. I'm no audiophile but the sound quality is good for a 2.1 set up.

If you sleep in the same room and you have sensitive ears, you'll want to turn it off.<br />2. I hate LEDs. I put a piece of black tape over the damn  bright light on the volume control.<br />3. sound adjustment is very jumpy. Will emit crackling static while adjusting volume. I also like to keep bass at a minimum without completely turn it down, which is difficult to achieve with the finicky controls. Fortunately for me, it's set and forget.<br />4. Headphone volume is significantly lower volume so you have to adjust everytime you use headphones.

"So I got  the IPad  a while back and after a while I was convinced that this could be a good overall replacement for 90% of the things that I normally would use my laptop.  The catch was the virtual keyboard provided by the software  It just wasn't enough, and covered half the screen, so it was going to be getting a keyboard of some type.<br /><br />While I have an apple cover for the IPad, I wanted a single unit rather than having to carry the IPad and case along w/ a keyboard.  I bought a cheap ($30) bluetooth keyboard, and it was better, but still lacked something.  The keys were clumsy, and the keyboard had been designed to fit any keyboard situation - windows or apple.  It connected easily, but it just missed a few ""notes"", as it were.<br /><br />So I started reading reviews for the various and sundry keyboard/case combinations that are out there, and over and over the logitech keyboard/case hit the top of people's lists.  I wanted one, but I wasn't going to be able to get it any time soon.<br /><br />Finally, wherewithal withed and I ordered the keyboard; amazon had the best new price, so they got the business.<br /><br />I just got the thing today and so far I have been pleasantly surprised with it.  I'm typing off the factory charge, and the key action is good and doesn't require hardly any adaptation from my normal typing style.  The keys are where my fingers are expecting them to be, even though the keyboard is smaller than a normal sized keyboard.<br /><br />While I haven't tried all the funciton keys, the two that I like right off the bat are the ""Lock"" function, and the ""Close window"" function.  The closewindow function is on the top far left and closes the current window you're in.  It's conveniently placed and the only function key that doesn't require hitting the &lt;function> key to enable; just a straight ""whak"" to close the window you're in.<br /><br />Linkage is good on both the hinge and the slot for the Ipad when viewing in landscape mode; in fact, when the IPad is placed in the holding slot for the keyboard/landscape portion, I can pick the whole unit up just by grabbing the IPad.<br /><br />The charging chord uses mini-usb, so I have a number of options to charge the keyboard.  I haven't had it long enough yet to test the length it holds a charge, but will update the review once I have more data.<br /><br />So there you go.  A very satisfied customer<br /><br />Update 29130813 -  I'm still happy with the keyboard/cover, and I'm STILL running off the 1st charge .  Very impressed.",positive,positive
"I purchased this for two reasons: a convenient way to display recipes that didn't require my phone being out, and streaming movies for when I'm in the kitchen for hours at a time.<br /><br />I rely heavily on streaming during the holiday seasons while I bake to fulfill orders, and while the video quality was good, and the sound was AMAZING, the rest of the device was too troublesome to be worth it.<br />Example: Open amazon video, and it gives you 4 categories to go through, or your library. I go to my library (severe lag every single time) and I find the movie I want. I hit play, severe lag again, and it plays. Quality is not bad at all, especially for the price, but heaven forbid you have to pause. Once you pause for ~2-3 minutes, it goes to a screen saver. And when you unlock it, you have to go through the process of finding the movie all over again. It's a pain in the butt. They could at least have a ""continue watching..."" at the beginning of the prime menu, but it doesn't.<br /><br />Secondly, our household has 3 users on our hulu account--if there was a way to switch users through the Echo, I didn't see it. I googled it, thinking I was overlooking it, and nothing. We all have very different tastes for shows/movies, and never use each others accounts for this reason. To have not one, but two streaming services being out of the question/too inconvenient to use, I couldn't handle it.<br /><br />The integration was wonky at best. I have an echo dot that resides on a window sill about 3 feet from where I had my echo. My echo was off for voice recognition, but when I'd talk to my dot, it would display on my echo. This was cool except for two things: 1. It did it intermittently. 1 out of 3 times it would mirror to the echo. 2. if you were streaming something when the echo mirrored what the dot was telling you, guess what, YOU HAVE TO FIND THE MOVIE AGAIN. It was a nightmare.<br /><br />Maybe down the road they'll figure out a more user friendly programming for this, but until then I'm returning it. It was meant to be a gift for family, but if I, an electronic savvy 30-something, can't figure it out, I wouldn't be comfortable giving it to my grandparents, which was the end goal.",neutral,positive

"As an e-reader it is great...back light, background shade and the usual font selection. I do not like the fact that deleted books remain ""on the shelf"" as opposed to the older kindles where one could send read books to the archives. Underlining text is sloppy at best.  Again, the older models with the cursor and toggle were far more accurate.<br /><br />Movies are far more expensive than DVDs and can only be viewed on screen as opposed to the TV/computer. The selection of free movies is limited.<br /><br />The news is quite handy; howeverr,  if you go to the full article, the print is extremely small.<br /><br />The carousel format leaves whatever you have viewed in front, so using the internet for information remains on the shelf...I guess forever.<br /><br />Granted, I have only had the Fire for a couple of weeks, but learning to use this reader is irritating for those of us who are computer folk.<br /><br />In summary, I recommend it as a reader, but not for movies, web brousing, etc.",neutral,positive

"The item I received had 2 large holes on the back, not 1 - the 2nd one is below the camera, to show the logo. Not at all what is pictured.

While the case itself is sturdy, it doesn't seem like it has enough padding to absorb drops. The inner liner is more of a soft plastic than a hard rubber.<br /><br />Pros: It is a nice, sleek case and will prevent body scratches. I also don't think the top and bottom brackets that hug the exposed rubber would really snap as easily as some reviewers said (at least on the item I received).

"This isn't a bad sounder, but its not a great sounder. It's middle of the road. The components/housing are fairly cheap and very basic. I feel like it I toy too much with it I might crack something. It works - not well, but it works. It claims readings on speeds well above where it performs. I lose consistent readings above 30mph. It typically displays ""---"" from 30 on, with an occasional read. Not a huge issue as my draft above 30mph is pretty shallow, but annoying nonetheless. It also registers false reads on a somewhat typical basis - meaning, I'm in 60 feet of water at least once an hour or so it will sound a low water alarm as if I was in 3-4 feet. Not a huge issue for the casual user - I'm not constantly bank fishing or anything where this might be continually annoying. I've turned the alarm off for the reason though - something I would like to keep on for safety issues. I use it for laying anchor (knowing how much rope to expect), safety for skiers, and clearance on certain spots on the lake. I do appreciate the water and air temp, a really nice and usable feature. All in all, its a fair sounder, and probably worth the money. If I had it to do over again, I would spring for something nicer.

"I was looking for a minimalist keyboard with the look and feel of the Apple Magic Keyboard, but really adapted for a Windows PC, and this one fit the bill perfectly. The build quality for this for this keyboard is fantastic and it certainly has the look and feel of a $100 keyboard. I love the automatic backlighting feature, which lights the keys up after they sense your hands nearby - I personally keep the backlights off, since the battery life drops precipitously after you switch them on. Logitech's software is also second to none and offers several options to change the keyboard features to your needs.<br /><br />I would say a few easy changes, would have made this keyboard perfect. 1) The keyboard rides pretty low and does not have legs to adjust tilt. 2) Because it rides so low, it's not the most comfortable keyboard to type on. Logitech sells a thin palm rest separately for $20, which to me seems like nickel and diming, especially for a keyboard of this quality. 3) Some people like the inverse dome design of the keys - I personally don't. I find the dome to be a mildly annoying as it just adds another texture to feel for when searching for keys. After a week, I got used to the new keys, but it's certainly a consideration when making this purchase.",positive,positive
"This is an awesome bag, and I really wish they added a compartment on the main pocket for the standard DSLR camera body size. The great thing about not having this is you could probably fit a C100 or Ursa Mini into it + a Lens.

I keep getting compared to ""Jim from the Office"" for some reason whenever I wear it to work, and it's way easier to cary around compared to my Pelican Case on wheels (Which I still use for bigger shoots) and this allows me to not have to leave my favorite body + lenses in my studio over the weekend, as they all fit perfectly in this bag.",positive,positive

"I bought this for a quick fix when I left my OEM supply home for a business trip. I have a Dell Precision M2800 which requires a 90W power supply. This power supply is in the range of 55-65W supplies which I have used before. I am very disappointed with it. The adapter charges my laptop at a rate of about 1% every 10 minutes. I also think my power management has throttled down the processor speed since I am running VERY slow as I type this. The [3-wire] AC side of the cable is extremely thin and high (a.k.a. small) gauge although it does not seem to be getting warm. If it was really supplying 90 watts I'd think it's be too resistive and creating some warmth. The adapter itself is very lightweight indicating minimal quality components inside.

Lots of room to grow (it looks like it'll hold another 200).  hehe  One thing I hadn't thought about, until I got it..... That carpeted outside picks up every little piece of dust, fuzz, fur, hair, etc.  I stood it up on my floor and YIKES, a new item to add to the vacuuming list.  But that's ok.  It's well worth it.  It keeps all my 45's protected and organized in one nice neat space (and it's even a portable space to boot).  I initially thought the price seemed a bit high, but after receiving it, it's worth every cent of it.  It's very well made and very durable (of course I haven't tried dropping it off a balcony or offering it up to American Tourister luggage gorillas, but I don't plan to either).  There was only a very mild odor when I first got it, but I don't notice it any more since it's been out of the box it was shipped in (unless I stick my face down inside the rows and take a big sniff, which I wouldn't be doing during the course of normal use of it).  As for the hinges on the back coming off to easily.  If you open it past about the 90 degree angle, the hinges will seperate, but it's no problem for me.  I like the fact that I can completely remove the top if I need or choose to.  I know what point they seperate and I either make sure I don't open it past that (unless I'm removing it), or I make sure I have a good hold on the lid when I do it.  Either way, it works out fine for me.  I couldn't be happier with it.  I would definitely recommend it for anyone that has 45rpm records.  And for those of us that are old enough to remember, it works on the older 78rpm records that were the same size as 45's, and also had the smaller hole in the center (like the regular albums).  Yes, I still have some of those 78's too.  I'd like to get the case like this that's made for CD's, but it doesn't hold very many (I think it said 150 in jewel cases) yet it's twice the price of the 45's case.  Not worth it for the number of those cases I'd need, to hold all my CD's.",positive,positive

"Our purchase of the TCL 55&#34; TV was based on price.  TCL does not have a code for Directv service.  After much trial and error, help with a very patient Directv agent, and our own persistance, we were able to find an RCA code to connect the Directv remote to the TV.  My husband tried over 30 codes.  The one he found which did work is:  11922<br />The picture quality is okay, not great.  Sound not very good & it sometimes take multiple attempts for the remote to respond to either sound volume or on/off.  I gave it 3 stars for the price.  Aside from that, it is an attractive unit with the bezel stand.",neutral,negative
Picked up a set of the AP670s to mount on my detached garage.  This set blew away my expectations.  They give off a nice warm deep sound and fill my backyard nicely.  Have them amplified through an inexpensive Moukey 240 watt amp.  Deep bass and clear highs. Easy to mount.  Hopefully they have a nice long life!  For the price I would totally recommend.  They sound like $300 speakers for half the price.  Shipping came much faster then amazon stated.<br /><br />Update: Almost 2 years later - these speakers still sound great.  The white grills were showing some rust so I took them off and gave them a quick coat of white spray paint and they look brand new again!  Definitely good speakers for the price!,positive,positive

"I've used this for quite while with both my wife's and my work iPad2's.  The design is great, acting as a hard cover to protect the screen when closed.  I like and trust the Logitech brand.<br /><br />I've found the synching to be spotty.  It will synch fine the first time but sometimes it will lose it's pairing and have to be reset fairly often.  Not sure if this is common to bluetooth b/c I have the same issue with a bluetooth audio receiver that I have.  It's a minor inconvenience but I should mention it.<br /><br />So the biggest issue is the ergonomics are suspect.  When the tablet is in the keyboard slot it is too close to your face, not like a laptop where there is some distance.  I originally thought that this keyboard paired with a iPad would be a laptop replacement but I decided I didn't like the tradeoffs of the worst ergonomics so I got a Samsung Chromebook for serious typing.  The tablet/keyboard solution is too cramped, too close, and loose (tablet will fall out of keyboard fairly easily if moved).",neutral,negative
"This case is only ok. The design is cute and the newest Paperwhite fit inside fine, but I was annoyed they didn't put more thought into the placement of the magnets.<br /><br />When you close the cover, the magnet should put the device to sleep. That's not what happens with this cover. The magnets don't catch, so the device remains awake until it times out (you didn't turn any pages for a certain amount of time, so the Kindle puts itself to sleep). It wastes battery life. You can also tell the magnet is very weak compared to other (cheaper) cases I've owned in the past.<br /><br />In essence, the magnets are too weak and not placed correctly. Sometimes they work if I squeeze the case closed at the spine, but even then it doesn't work 90% of the time. It's a very simple quality control issue that they simply didn't care to fix. Sure, I can turn the Kindle off manually, but for the price of this case I'm disappointed its basic features don't work.",neutral,negative

"I purchased this TV specifically for the G-Sync feature, however the G-Sync option does not appear in the nvidia control panel. I have a RTX 2080 (not the ti, not the super) and it should work right? but the option doesn't show and the screen still has just as much visual lag as my non-gsync TV. in game mode that is, however it doesn't default to game mode and without game mode on, the lag is horrendous.<br /><br />also i could not get the PC option to do 1440p 120hz as described in some videos i watched that should enable the gsync feature, and yes i checked the TV's firmware to the most recent version and my nvidia drivers on windows 10 is the most recent. i could only get 30fps on 1440p but i could get 60hz at 4k, and 120hz at 1080p, but at 1080p there is text smearing that i can't stand.<br /><br />i was able to adjust the picture to be mostly clear by adjusting the picture settings and the sharpness of the text to be almost completely clear at 1080p and crisp at 4k, but i didn't get this screen to play at 4k 60hz but at 1440p 120hz i might have settled on 1080p 120hz if the text didn't smear.<br /><br />it is also super thin on the top half and sides, the bottom half - middle has 2"" bump out on the back that connects to the wall mount or the table stand, and has the video connections. because of this super thinness it makes it difficult to move and will require one person on each side handling it from the bottom to move, you may need a couple of friends to help put this together. the included visual instructions were difficult/impossible to understand, with no text to explain, only visuals, i couldn't understand them, but i was able to figure out how to put the table stand together and get it to work. it does not come with any wall mount screws, or a hdmi cable. and the remote, paperwork and screws were in the top of the box. since i pulled the box up off the tv and the top styrofoam stuck to the top inside of the box i had to pull out the styrofoam to find them hidden.<br /><br />after fiddling with the settings, drivers and searching forums and youtube for hours, i finally gave up and am going to return this TV and maybe LG will fix this in the future, and with 30 series cards from nvidia yet to come to truly take advantage of the features of this screen, i will wait even longer before trying this again. the global situation for everyone right now, prevented me from doing what i really wanted to do, visit a store and see it in action, ask questions from one of the reps and be able to take it home that day, instead waiting weeks on delays from amazon delivery, that added to the frustration and made it even more annoying to get this and not have it work as expected.<br /><br />if you plan to use this for a TV or a smart internet connected device and not for PC gaming, it will do that job perfectly fine. if you bought it for gsync PC gaming, you may be disappointed, i found plenty of forum postings with people unable to get the function to work with no working solutions.",negative,positive
"I just got this phone, and my previous phone was a Samsung Galaxy s20 FE.<br /><br />This phone is a lesson in frustration. Soooo many bugs.<br /><br />The finger print reader often does not recognize my print. Facial recognition doesn't work at all. Password manager is hit and miss, it will supposedly save the passwords, but then does not automatically populate into apps/sites. Battery life is rather lacking, as well.<br /><br />I also have Google Fi as my carrier, which itself is so so, and I came to Fi from US Cellular. Let me tell you, Fi technical support is abysmal. I used the chat option, I was transferred 3 times, to 4 different teams, and even though it's a brand new phone, their only ""solution"" was factory reset, after an hour and a half. They refusesvto escalate my issue, stating there's no one to escalate to. Seriously, from your tier 0 or 1 agents, there's no escalation path? I then tried the Google support call me option, which then I actually got somewhere... My phone started automatically populating some apps/sites. But of course, the next day, it quit again, even though I've clicked save in password manager and if you go into password manager, the credentials are there, there just do not populate into the apps/sites.<br /><br />Smart lock...

"At the newly lowered price I jumped on this quickly. It is fairly simple to setup and use, it's constantly broadcasting itself so that makes for easy finding and pairing with any bluetooth device.

Build quality is top notch.<br /><br />Unfortunately it fails at sound quality. It really sounds like i'm playing music through a tin can. I've tried it with multiple bluetooth  signal sources: Two Android phones (Droid Incredible 2 & HTC Rezound), laptop, macbook, and iPad.

"It's been over a year now since I purchased this phone and I must say this is by far the best phone I've owned. I am a verizon customer and was eligible for an upgrade so I began looking at my options. Until now I have been a faithful Droid user but I wasn't impressed with the offerings at the time so I looked at other manufacturers. Among many of the other features, I was intrigued by the fact that this phone came with a stylus and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Being a longtime Prime customer, I always look to Amazon before making a purchase elsewhere and to my delight Amazon had this phone for $100. less than I could get it from Verizon even with my upgrade promo pricing. This phone is truly a pocket PC, when I'm out of the office I use this phone constantly for work. Out of full disclosure, I did just recently purchase a laptop for working in the field but that is only because I need to be able to update projects using adobe premier and illustrator which of course I can't do on this phone.<br /><br />The battery life seems to have diminished a bit but I have so many apps installed and running that is to be expected. I do plug it in every time I'm in my vehicle and I pack a backup USB charger in my EDC bag in case of an emergency.<br /><br />The camera and video quality is light years ahead of my old Droid Razr Hd and the time it takes for the camera to initiate and snap a picture or start recording takes only a few moments compared to my old Droid.<br /><br />To conclude this review, this is the best phone I've owned and I highly recommend it.",positive,positive

I don't to be the one charged with the ticket I am cut off on the road! I was hoping this would be a great inexpensive solution, but It has too many challenges to overcome. It's a bit large for my windshield and I was hard pressed to find a good spot where it didn't impair my visibility because I already have a transponder occupying the space behind my rear view mirror, which is obscured by some sort of black light diffusing material. The other challenge was the power cord. There is no place in my car where it wouldn't interfere with the center controls on my dash (AC, radio, etc). The only other option would be using the center console auxiliary outlet and taping the cord in several places. It's gonna hang somewhere though. I wonder if there are any solar powered options? This one just is a no go for me. The field of view seemed pretty narrow as well. It was a very inexpensive camera ($16 lightening deal) and I would probably return it if it were not too late.

"The lightweight iPad cover is not red, more of a hot pink color FYI.<br />I needed to replace my old iPad cover and since its an older model there weren't that many offerings left in the official Apple leather case division. I decided to try out a Chinese manufactured foam case that mimics the leather flip fold of my original.<br />It fits fine. So that isn't a problem. The material is a kind of medium density one piece foam with magnets built into the lid flap. The sleep mode works just fine and the lid will put the iPad into sleep without a problem. BUT, the flap does not stay closed and I am forever seeing light come from my satchel or handbag when the flap flops open. The flap is really loose and does not support the iPad standing up for viewing when on a table (the designers didn't copy the correct geometry of the triangle stand aspect.

"This sleeve is relatively good quality and is good looking.<br />I personally don't like the bright color and wish it had options for darker tones or even black. Especially since my iPad is in space gray.<br />However there is one tiny detail that made me change my mind about it entirely. If you own a iPad pro 12.9"" 2018 moder and an apple pencil 2, you know that in order to charge the pen, the pen should be magnetically attached to the top of the tablet. Now, with the pen an the original keyboard case attached, the zipper won't close. You can carry the pen only if it is placed on the side of the tablet. It brings me to the conclusion that the design of the sleeve has not been updated to adjust to the latest version of the iPad. So, if your pen is out of charge and you ate planning to move the tablet in the sleeve, you either have to leave it open or put the pen aside and close the zipper.

"Warning to Mac users. I'm an IT guy at an entirely Mac organization.

"This is an odd review to write. Quality is &#34;5&#34; -- genuine Canon, hard plastic, great quality, not a cheap knock off. However, it clearly is intended for the EF-S 75-300 lens. It will not fit a Canon EF-S 55-250, despite some sellers' claim to the contrary. I ordered mine through Tri-State on Amazon based on that claim. There are so many lens hoods, it is confusing. When it arrived, it would not fit. The correct hood for the 55-250mm zoom is, as I have since learned, the Canon ET-63. The return policy was very specific to packing and such (I had tossed most of what they needed) so I ate the lens hood and cost. Lesson learned. So, in summary, it is a good, high-quality, genuine Canon product, but make sure it will fit your lens.",neutral,positive

"This is basically a USB host cable that delivers power, and a mini USB hub with Ethernet built in. I wish I could review them separately because the USB host part works perfectly! I tried it on several devices (including my Moto G5 Plus smartphone) and it gives everything a USB port to plug a peripheral into. I wanted this for my Amazon FireStick 4k, which was successfully given a USB port which can be used for things like game controllers and wireless keyboard/mouse combos, etc.<br />The USB hub + Ethernet works alright- the USB ports, at least, work fine. I'm able to plug in a keyboard and wireless controller adapter dongle, and everything works fine and is recognized by the Firestick. You can even plug in a USB storage stick to play local content. But I REALLY wanted the Ethernet port to get a stronger connection by the TV for streaming. I know there are other USB host / ethernet combos that work with the FireStick, it is capable of working with the right hardware. I thought this would be one of them since it claims to be ""for Streaming TV Stick"" in the description, however the Ethernet port does NOT work. I'll have to try to source my own and see if I can use it with the USB host this offers. The Ethernet port did show up on my Windows desktop when I tried the hub there, so maybe it just isn't compatible with Android/non desktops? I don't know. If that's the feature you want, this might not work for you.",neutral,positive

I also thought since the board has a barrel power connector, that it also had a voltage regulator... but it does NOT... it simply feeds whatever comes it, directly to the Vin pin of the Nano.  The NRF24 header also has no voltage regulator, so it feeds the 3.3v from the Nano to the radio module.  Will likely end up returning these.",neutral,negative

"If you have any interest in modding headphones, these are the ones to get. You can use your own materials you get at a hobby shop or purchase kits sold online, like the Mayflower kit. It would help if you have the ability to take measurements but using your ears works okay too. I ended up getting the Mayflower kit, some ZMF earpads and a new cable (the stock cable is pretty microphonic). These things blew away all my other headphones after the mods, including Grado SR80e, Sennheiser HD 58x and Monoprice M1060C open modded. You can mod them to your desire enjoyment but I modded mine for elevated bass response and a rolled off treble (stock the treble was a little too spikey for me) and now they're an absolute blast to listen to. Not as accurate or as neutral as they were stock but to my ears, a lot more enjoyable to listen to.<br /><br />Also, you don't need an expensive amp to power these.

"I been shopping a large screen 16:9 monitor for about a year now and was looking at the Sceptre Curved 40"" originally. Both monitors specs matched and after reading the good reviews on that one. I was really hopeful with this monitor. I'm not a fan of curved screen but this one is really mild so I figured I would give it a shot since it checked my wants and it was on sale.<br />The pros are its large, arrived in good condition, came with matching cables and the interface is cleanly laid out.<br />Now the not so good, (Tested on a win 10 and 11 pc one running an amd  5700xt card the other nvidia 3070) .<br />The glossy screen is horrible for reflections (unless in a pitch black room)<br /> Windows wants to automatically set it a 200% scaling (native) you have to go back and set it at 100%.  You have to manually set it at 165 hrz using display port. Using HDMI it wont go over 90hrz (tried 3 different cables on both pc's)<br />  Movie quality is good, but dark scenes are too dark and bright are over bright, even set in movie mode using stock settings.<br /> Text is clear unless you are scrolling, then it gets a blur till you stop scrolling then it clears right up (both on hdmi and DP) So reading documents or spread sheets is good unless you need to be constantly scrolling up and down.(one reason I wanted a larger screen so I did not have to scroll)<br /> As for the color gamut when editing photos or video (You Tube) I cannot see any color difference between this monitor and my old 2016 asus 27"".<br /> I'm not a heavy gamer (couple hrs a week) and don't play first person shooters I cannot give an in-depth opinion,  but Assassin's Creed in fight scenes I get bad ghosting same with tomb raider. If its a run around for the scenery then the monitor is good but fast action leaves alot to be desired (old asus 27"" 1080P is much better)  I also checked it using Blur Busters UFO Motion Tests<br /> I reached out to their support via their web site a week ago incase I am overlooking a setting and still have not heard back.<br /> My final thoughts on this monitor is it can do everything but can't do anything well,  not hearing back from CS has me questioning their service if it does go bad under the warranty period.",negative,positive

"I bought this chip with a B450-F chipset on a new motherboard, knowing that chipset does support the 3700X after a BIOS update. I took the gamble hoping my motherboard had the update, but it didn't. I also knew before hand that AMD had a boot kit loan where they loan you a CPU to update your motherboard. Sadly I didn't look into the boot kit loan more before I bought the CPU. If your motherboard doesn't have CPU-less EZ flash, and you don't have an older AM4 processor, you'll need to get an older AM4 processor or go through AMD's loan service.<br /><br />AMD makes it an extremely tedious process to get a loan from them. You have to contact the manufacturer of your motherboard first, and get an e-mail or text chat from them stating that AMD's loan kit is the best option (as in, there's no way the motherboard manufacturer can help you). Then you have to send that, an invoice, pictures of your processor, and pictures of your motherboard. Even after doing all of this AMD wasn't happy with one of my pictures, delaying the boot kit even more.<br /><br />What's worse is it takes them about a day to respond, and they don't work on weekends. You have to send an initial ""i need a boot kit"" e-mail first too, so you're waiting at least a day before you can send them your documents, then hope they approve of them, then they ship you off the loan kit.<br /><br />By the time I got approved I had found somebody selling an older AM4 processor on craigslist for cheap so I just went and bought that and updated my motherboard that way. The boot kit service is extremely inconvenient and they require almost government ID levels of verification that you own the stupid processor for some reason.<br /><br />Now that it's up and running, the processor was well, well worth the money. I wouldn't have bought the B450-F chipset had I known the loan kit was going to be such an impossibility to get. Make sure you can update your motherboard or buy one that supports third gen Ryzen without an update.",neutral,positive

The parts are not available, and don't see them being available anytime soon.  LG then offered to replace the TV with a brand new unit.  I was OK with that.  After checking inventory, there were no 55LX9500's anywhere in stock.  LG then offered a refurbished unit as a replacement.  I was a little uneasy with this, but I agreed to take a refurbished unit.  After checking inventory, there were no refurbished 55LX9500's anywhere in stock.  LG then offered a 2011 comparable model replacement.  I got a little excited, but then was let down when I was told that there was no model to replace this TV.  LG finally said that they will give me a refund for the amount I paid for the TV, but not the 3D glasses I purchased that only work with the 2010 LG TV's.  Luckily, the retailer I purchased them form said that they would take them back outside of their normal return policy for in-store credit. (Thank you OneCall, you guys are GREAT!!)<br /><br />LG Customer Service told me that I should be receiving a phone call from their logistics company to pick up the TV.  At this point, the screen started displaying vertical stripes on the right half of the screen.  The TV was still viewable, but it was rather annoying.  After waiting a week, I contacted LG Customer Service again, and was told that I should have been provided with the contact information for the logistics company on the first call I made.  I then contacted the logistics company, and gave them the reference number I had received.  The logistics company couldn't find any reference to me, or my reference number.  I then called LG Customer Service again, and I was told that they hadn't yet entered my return request. (after a week)  I was then assured that they would be entering it by the end of business that day, and should be receiving a call from the logistics company ""Within a few business days"".  That night, the TV has stopped working completely.  It is now 3 day later, and I still haven't heard from the logistics company.  This is the only TV I have in my house, and it doesn't work.  I have to wait for LG to receive the TV in their warehouse, and inspect it before they will issue a refund.<br /><br />I can then order a new TV, and wait for it to be delivered.  After this level of customer service I have received from LG, I will NOT be purchasing another LG product.",negative,positive

"Attention photographers!<br />This is not as showen in the picture!<br />I was so excited to get this beautiful image as a backdrop and being able to create portraits with night vibes. But the advertized image and the printed backdrop are two different things! It was poorly made and printed so unproffesionaly, the colors don't look the same as the original digital image that you see on Amazon. It is not blue. It is light blue and looks like a day. I'm guessing they got a tiny image online, with a low resulotion that looks good only when it is tiny and only online.<br />Another problem: these people are not from the industry and don't know how to print! They printed on the wrong material with the wrong color setting! The result is a joke. If you are a proffesional photographer like me, you would be ashamed to use it in your studio. The background is so lowtech and not realistic that photos created with this, would look lame! Not to mention that I strugelled to get a refund for this backdrop, and a few other stupid backdrops I ordered at a same time. I told Amazon they should stop dealing with these unproffesional sellers that have no dignity, no proffesionalty, and no customer service.",negative,negative

"Though I use Windows XP, my computer is old and my processor (Sempron) is not what is required to run the ""KODAK Share Button"" app to transfer videos from the Kodak Playful, Model Ze2 to my computer.  That's too bad.  But anyway, be sure to check the specs before buying so this won't happen to you.  I downloaded the program anyway but it wouldn't run.  So, I've tried just about everything I know to do and nothing seems to work.  An old ""FinePixViewer"" program keeps popping up every time I try to download a video, but it takes a very long time for it to finally work.  I guess technology is trying to force me to buy a newer/faster computer because so many gadgets won't work on poor ole' Bessie anymore despite her having 34 GB left of memory and 4GB of ram.<br /><br />The camera itself is fun to play with and I like the 1970's film mode, but it would be better if the theme to ""Shaft"" was being quietly played in the background while using that particular mode. The access doors are very difficult to open and you will probably lose some fingernails until you get it figured out. The Kodak website is not very good.....I never could find a place where I could ask a question directly to technical support.  And the web addresses provided in the manual take you to the same web page regardless of the the specifics written into the web address like: [...].  They all take you to the same place and you have to hunt and peck where you want to go and what you're looking for.  And they have no Ze2 demos to watch - go figure. And though Windows XP is listed in a drop menu, when I click on it absolutely nothing happens.  So much for Windows XP help.<br /><br />I'm giving it 3 stars because the doors are a pain, and the website is inadequate.  But since I don't own a computer that will allow the Kodak program to work I can't fairly judge the quality of the videos.  When I can get FinePixView to play them they look alright.  I have yet to connect the Kodak Playful directly to my HDTV to see how the HD (720) quality and sound are, and I will do that and report back.  I am very interested especially in the sound quality since I'm a musician/music teacher and like to record my students playing.<br /><br />UPDATE:  2.17.12<br />I used the Kodak Playful to record my daughter playing guitar in her school's talent show.  It did a good job and I was finally able to upload the video to my old computer.  Also, I ended up breaking off the door that covers the USB plug which was nearly impossible to open without losing fingernails and then equally impossible to shut close again.  The plug stays inside without the door and though I hated doing it, it works much better now.",neutral,positive

"Worked well for just about a year.  When the computer reboots (but sometimes at random) the blaster's task bar icon on Windows 8.1 will activate then deactivate then activate then deactivate -- which is pretty visible as the whole task bar icon set jumps around as the icon appears and disappears.  The blaster's box has a blue light and it will just flash on and off during this time.  Needless to say no sound is available when it is going through these convulsions.  The simplest fix is to unplug the USB from the blaster and then plug it back in and it will generally recover and be just fine. Once again, however, I delayed deciding that the problem was now bad enough to check into the warranty and I missed the one year warranty by about 2 weeks.<br /><br />Otherwise, it worked well when it was working ... well.

It closes down to about 2-3/4"".<br /><br />Second, the four holes to receive the softbox rods are only 1/8"" in diameter. All my softbox rods are much larger and will not fit. I could drill the holes out, but it's just too big and heavy for what I want to do.<br /><br />The unit is very sturdy -- made of cast metal. The screws are about 5/16"" in diameter (possibly metric) and are not tiny flimsy things. The rubber tips are strong and secure. The two rings can rotate against each other for turning the softbox after mounting and there's a locking thumbscrew to secure them from moving after positioning.<br /><br />This ring would be fine if: 1) your rods are 1/8"" in diameter and 2) your light is in the 5"" diameter range.<br /><br />My old Medalight monolights are 3-3/4"" in diameter. Technically, this ring could fit, but would be screwed almost all the way to min diameter. The biggest problem is that the holes don't fit my flexrods.",neutral,negative

I have to press down for over 10 seconds before they turn on/off (with my already paired devices) which was not the case with the blk headphones.

"I’ve been birding for over 40 years on two continents. During that time, the biggest improvement I’ve seen is a phenomenal advance in the quality of optics available at a reasonable cost. Recently there’s been a flood of 10x42 binoculars on the market, and I decided to test several. This pair by Eyeskey offers simply astounding optical performance in this price range — BUT, like a Shakesperean character, also possesses several fatal flaws that prove its downfall. The worst flaws include a terrible close focus distance of 7m (23 ft.), and a rough, uneven focusing knob. I would recommend looking for a different well-rated binocular in the same price range. Although I’m steering you away from these, here are some Pros and Cons to use in comparison with other binoculars:<br /><br />PROS:<br />+ Bright, crisp view is amazing for this price<br />+ Very little haloing around subject even against white clouds<br />+ Nice low-light performance<br />+ BAK4 prism (Note: A higher number, like BAK7, is worse)<br /><br />CONS:<br />– Close focus distance of 7m (23 ft.) is too far, especially for birding<br />– Rough, uneven focusing knob makes focusing difficult and unpleasant<br />– Too narrow field of view (305ft/1000yds)<br />– Very loose twist-up eyecups will probably not stay in place (I’m an eyeglass wearer and left them all the way down)<br />– Sharp edge of binocular strap hurts neck<br /><br />I really, really liked the view from these binoculars, but it was spoiled by too many flaws. Look elsewhere for a better pair, though you may have to spend a little more to match the optical quality.",negative,positive

"My MacBook Pro (2017, Intel) only has Thunderbolt ports, so I’ve become well acquainted with different hubs over the years. This Anker USB-C Hub is small enough to take on the go, with a plastic, faux-leather feeling exterior and a braided cable for durability, but it has some limitations.<br /><br />The USB-C port is only for power delivery input. It doesn’t support data transfer or video, if you have a monitor with a USB-C output. The T-shaped connector on the hub is big and bulky, it almost blocks the port next to it. On M1 MacBook Pros, the connector does block different ports on each side.<br /><br />There are two USB-A ports, they are only for peripherals and data transfer.

"Of all of the ""economy"" ear buds that I've owned over the last few years these are at the top of my list for decent sound.  They seem to produce a richer, fuller sound than any other similarly priced ear buds that I've tried.  I've used the ear candy brand, 2 x Sony brand and one or two others and these seem to beat them all.  The sound quality may be good, however, the physical quality of these buds are just plain disgraceful.  I've now owned 2 sets of these head phones and they've both only lasted about 6-8 months a piece.  I use them almost solely at my desk and both have had one of the buds die for absolutely no reason at all.  It's very frustrating to me to shell out $20 for something only to know I'll get decent sound quality for only a few months.

"and not a cent more or less. I've now tested five different monitors at different price points under $600. The conclusion I've come to is that with these ""gaming"" monitors, you get exactly what you pay for. First, reviewers and tech Youtubers will tell you that TN and VA panels are fine. They are not. Their color and sometimes brightness suck compared to IPS. We are gaming on these things, the picture is literally the most important part of our gaming rigs next to our CPU and GPU, right? Right. So don't settle for a cheap monitor. It's massively important to get a good monitor but there are soooo many options is quite confusing.<br />Don't settle for a VA or TN monitor. The only reason you should be using a TN is if you are a PvP min-maxer or competitive e-Sports player where every GtG response millisecond counts. For VA, well there is zero reason to settle for those washed out colors when plenty of ""gaming"" IPS panels are out there now. The colors on this cheap $150 LG IPS panel are better than the popular budget Viotek VA panel that costs $350 for example.<br />But here's the catch, not even all IPS panels are created equal. A cheap IPS panel like this $150 LG, isn't as bright and doesn't have nearly as vibrant of colors as the $400 Acer IPS I settled on after my tests. LG has better IPS panels like all of the other manufacturer's do, but they are priced accordingly. This monitor has no height adjustment and sits low on the desk, so you can instantly add $20-30 to your overall cost for a VESA mount adapter or monitor stand. After comparing 2K (1440P) resolution at 27"" screen size vs. HD (1080p) the difference is definitely noticeable. If you didn't know any better, you may think a 27"" HD resolution is fine for gaming. If you compared the two, you'd never want to return to HD on a 27"". The extra pixels per square inch a 2K screen has make everything look better from text while typing to in-game graphics. Also, there is a reason that 144hz or higher is very popular lately for gaming monitors. Between this 75hz monitor, and a 144hz, while gaming, there is a very noticeable smoothness to the moving objects on the screen with the 144hz. The 75hz appears a tiny bit choppy. I've seen it referred to as micro stutters. I don't know if I'd call it that, but it gives you an idea of the smoothness you get with a high hz.<br />To sum it up:<br />Pros - low price, Freesync, IPS vivid color, LG quality<br />Cons - pixelated picture at 27"" HD resolution, low budget IPS not as bright and vibrant as higher end IPS, no height adjustment, low hz (under 144hz), empty space between the edge of the screen and the bezel, looks like a defect but its by design.",neutral,positive

"This is a small lens which feel right on the Z50. The most important thing about this lens is its 12mm focal length which is something you are not going to find in a Z mount from Nikon, Sigma or Tokina. I knew it was manual focus but it is also manual F stop - you have to manually adjust the F stop and the camera has no idea what the chosen F stop is. So your exposure options are either aperture priority or manual mode. The Z50 handles the exposure pretty well using aperture priority.  There is noticeable vignetting and smearing in the corners. The picture included is a corner that shows the smearing. Still at the price I would recommend this lens because it does give you a valuable focal length that is unavailable elsewhere.",neutral,positive

I was told ""Hello, please make sure that your original remote control supports these 2 shortcut button functions, otherwise you can only use the  Smart Hub button to access these programs.""<br />Since the voice remote does not I consider their description misleading. They should specify that it won't work for Amazon and Netflix unless original remote did. Not worth sending back so Ill play with it a bit and see what else it does.",neutral,positive

"I got this camera for my wife. I use several Canon DSLR's, but she just wants to &#34;point and shoot&#34;.<br />This Canon is rather large but very light.

It's $300 but it is very compact,<br />takes great photos and is simple to use.<br />The one additional pet peeve I had with this camera is that Canon does not supply<br />an owners manual.

Worked as advertised for about a week.  Now it barely works and mostly won't even make a connection like what it was designed to do.  I'd ask for my money back but it ain't worth the trouble.  I'd ask for another pair but it ain't worth it either.,negative,positive

There are times I’m reclined in my chair and I feel like listening to music, and low and behold, I have to get up and sync them. Having just used them the night before, you would think that by connecting them through your settings on your phone would be enough. My other blue tooth devices don’t do this. Also, I have to have my volume up on my phone almost to max to enjoy these. The pairing on these is weak. Twenty minutes into listening, they sometimes start to blink off and get staticky.<br />I’m not sure why there are so many positive reviews on these, maybe high percentage are fake. I would never again purchase another JBL product.",negative,negative

"I have never had a problem with my battery chargers until I bought this BM Premium charger.  All of these chargers look the same, but some are much more reliable than others.  This one is not reliable.<br />When I tried to charge an Canon OEM battery with this charger, the charger got hot and the red light (charge indicator) started blinking.  I removed the battery and let things cool down and tried again.  It did the same thing.  This made me think that I had a defective battery, but I decided to try charging it in my camcorder (Canon HF R800).  The camcorder charged it fine with no problems.<br /><br />I was puzzled by this.  Several days later I tried the charger again.  Same result: blinking red light and the charger had gotten hot.  I ordered a new one from a different vendor and different brand and it charged the battery without any problems.<br /><br />As far as I am concerned, the quality control of this manufacturer leaves a lot to be desired.

"This thing would be great if it worked.<br /><br />Pros:<br />None, since it doesn't work.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. The lower section quit locking after a couple of uses. Even disregarding the following cons, this alone disqualifies this as a usable tool. When I needed it, it failed to hold up my camera and there was nothing I could do in the field to make it work. And there is no way to disassemble for repair or adjustment.<br />2. It's heavy.<br />3. The rubber foot can fall off easily and get lost, leaving you with an aluminum ball with a spike sticking out.<br />4. It's too long even at its shortest length.<br />5. For its high cost, it has no ability to angle the camera on top. You have to add a tilt head like a 3232 or ball head to make this work.<br />6. No convenient way to carry it when not needed. It's so long and heavy, if you try to attach it to your belt with a carabiner when you don't need it, it's really annoying as it bangs against your leg.<br />7. Too expensive. It's one leg of a tripod, with no top casting and no real head.<br /><br />There is a small recessed adjustment screw in the squeeze/lock handle, but it does not seem to do anything. Can't find the owner's manual on line.<br /><br />Expensive mistake.<br /><br />UPDATE: As my Amazon return window has closed, I have emailed Manfrotto about getting it repaired and received no response. I am stuck with a $143 aluminum stick that doesn't work. Sickening. Buy at your own risk.",negative,negative
"Surprising enough it is a nice shield. The fit was not quite right, but it works. Even though you have to use a solution on it, it was not that hard.

Now with this case, I have no problems. The light on the case lights up the kindle perfectly.",positive,positive
Got this originally for when driving the big truck.  Owned and used it for about 3 years as of this writing.  Gave it a five star due to durability and quality.  Updates easy online with the lifetime update maps I purchased separately.  As with any GPS you still need to reference a road atlas.  I also like the ability to switch from truck mode to car mode when needed.  Traffic function is a plus.  So if you are looking for a good quality GPS and the screen size is what you need.......look no further.,positive,positive
"Overall quality is good, and I prefer cable matters products - however this particular cable is flawed because the mini-display port has a bulge in the molded connector that makes it much wider than it should be.

The sound quality is fantastic as well. I only have 2 complaints about it.<br />1. It takes an eternity to fully charge, and then the battery drains way faster than I'd like it to (about 3 hours of constant use).<br />2. The Bluetooth distance is very limited. You basically have to keep your phone or music device right next to it or the music starts cutting out and sounding like a skipping CD.<br />So if you want to use it unplugged, make sure you're charge it for a full day before you use it. And keep your audio device within ten feet or so if you want to avoid your music cutting out.",neutral,positive

Unlike other keyboard/mouse combos on my Toshiba Encore 8"" Windows tablet, this one plays well with my mouse at the same time.<br /><br />Since I dont have an apple tv, I just slipped the little silicon apple remote sleeve off and it works great as a little windows keyboard.<br /><br />The keys are a little mooshy, but they do give tactile feedback and with some practice you could type pretty quickly.<br /><br />I love that its a fully keyed keyboard, this little thing has the same keys that my daily keyboard has, plus a few...<br /><br />This keyboard did not come with a USB dongle, which is fine, since my tablet has bluetooth built in, but the information above is deceiving.<br /><br />Also, I dont think this model comes with a gyro mouse, I have not read anything in the manual on how to activate it and have yet to discover how.  Not a problem for me, since I have a touch screen.<br /><br />It has a removable lithium ion battery, from what I saw in a review it is a standard battery for easy replacement.

Still not sure it's worth the premium price. YMMV.<br /><br />UPDATE: I tried again with a not-refurb. So far Hello seems to be working great. The pic quality is still off--too white. I've tried messing with the settings, but I can't seem to find the right one. And anyways, it should be automatically great at this price point.",neutral,positive
"The display is much too dim during the day, and a bit bright at night. I think this depends a lot on mounting location and angle, as it will appear brighter if canted toward the driver, and dimmer if pointing straight toward the back seat (ie not toward the driver's eyes.)  The clear plastic over the display is curved and really really smooth/shiny, so it will cause reflections no matter what angle it's mounted, and the reflections are brighter than the display making it nearly impossible to read.<br /><br />The dimmer function is controlled via a button on the front panel, but it doesn't do much at all. Other manufacturers have a wire that goes to the car's wiring harness to control the dimmer, but for some reason pioneer couldn't figure that out. I would get something else if I were to do this again.<br /><br />Everything else on the unit works well, though it's hard to get to the menus to access basic things like fade and balance.

I carry the player around with me and listen to it at random times of the day to make use of ""dead times"". So I needed earphones that I didn't need to spend time untangling wires, unwinding, pulling out of a case, etc; yet still sound reasonably good.<br /><br />The retractability of these headphones are exactly what I needed. The units auto retract the cords with a button, and pull back out with just a pull. Perfect; no tangled wires, winding, or cases. The units clip over the ear like the ends of a pair of glasses. This works only if you are standing upright. If you lie down, they tend to fall off.<br /><br />Sound wise, they are comparable to the $22 headphones they are, which makes them about the same sound quality as equivalently priced Sony's and about the same or slightly better than the white earbuds that come with ipods. Due to the position over the ears, bass is kind of lost.<br /><br />Overall I'm happy with the units; particularly for their quick to use nad reasonable sound.",positive,positive

"I used a Logitech M570, a thumb trackball, for years until I started gaming again and needed a gaming mouse. Now I’m done with gaming for a while and have been searching for a trackball to reduce strain.<br /><br />The Kensington Orbit Fusion Wireless Trackball is the first Kensington trackball I’ve tried.<br /><br />I hate the scroll ring. I think this is either a feature you love or hate, and well, I just don’t like it. Using the scroll ring is uncomfortable for me; I keep going back to my laptop trackpad instead of using it. It’s too easy to move the trackball while using the scroll ring, and I couldn’t decide which finger was most comfortable for using it. I spent a lot of time fiddling with the scrolling speed in the KensingtonWorks program, but content doesn’t move smoothly on my screen -- it jumps.<br /><br />The mouse is too big for my hand. I usually wear a size small in women’s winter and nitrile gloves, to give an idea of the size. My fingers have to stretch too much to reach the left and right click buttons at the same time. My hand rises off the mouse when I use the scroll ring.<br /><br />I know some of this is muscle memory, but my wrist and hand actually hurt after using the trackball for more than a few minutes.<br /><br />I do like that KensingtonWorks can be used on Windows or Mac. I’ve tried a lot of high end gaming mice that I can’t always customize on my Mac. KensingtonWorks lets you modify the pointer, scroll ring, and customize the buttons. You can also back up your settings to Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive, and set options for specific programs. Kensington also included a USB-A to USB-C adapter.",negative,positive

"The design of this combination Bluetooth keyboard and hard clamshell case for the iPad Air looks good at first glance and performed very well in everyday use—for around 10 months.  Then the plastic strip on the bottom of the hinge popped off and could not be made to stay back on.  A month or so later the top part of the hinge separated itself from the top of the case, so it's no longer to position the top of the case with the iPad in place at a convenient angle for typing.<br /><br />The bottom half with the keyboard is also a bit lighter than the top half with the iPad installed, so it's not as stable as it could be.<br /><br />Now after almost a year the keyboard continues to work (although it still tends to generate multiple keystrokes from a single key strike) but the unit itself it not in good shape.  So I give Zagg points for overall design but the unit fails badly when it comes to durability.  And I'm very careful to always carry it in a padded case and generally avoid knocking it about.  For the price, I think we should expect something a bit less fragile.  I'm now looking for a replacement and will be checking out other brands and styles.",neutral,negative

"Generally I am quite happy with the end result once issues were settled.  I bought two boxes (8 liights total).  One unit however failed to charge. I even placed it in the sunniest spot of the 8 locations I used and once the battery went dead it never replenished itself.  Depending on how you look at it, that's either a 12.5% failure rate or a 50% failure rate (since I had to return one entire box of 4 to Amazon).  I also had swapped batteries with another unit to determine if it was a battery issue or a charging issue.  Turns out the one unit would not charge either of two batteries.  They have a warranty from Mr. Beams and I had hoped that they would respond to the email I sent and offer to swap just the one unit because I didn't want to change out all four for fear I get another defective one in the replacement box.  My email went unanswered.  So I instead exchanged the whole box through Amazon.<br /><br />However, once that was sorted out, the lights are generally great.  I'm in SoCal and although we have a decent number of sunny days, it is wintertime, the days are short, and the lights are not necessarily located in the most sunny areas in my yard and the sun is at an angle such that not all the lights get a great deal of sunlight.  I love the two-stage setting where they are on dimmed during the night and only brighten when motion is detected.  Once the dead unit was swapped out, all units make it through the night to the dawn and are still on when we get up just before sunrise except for one unit one morning was on and then within another 15 minutes or so it gave up.  However, it did charge again and was on the next night.  So I'll attribute that one to lack of sunlight and in a location that gets the least light of all my lights.  The battery appears to be a fairly substantial 3.7V ""stick"" battery.  I'm glad they did give it a battery that is of good capacity to last all night long.<br /><br />The design could be better in two ways though.  First, the mounting seems backwards.  The top screw is exposed and the bottom one is hidden and the unit hooks onto the screw head.  This seems backwards to me, at lest for use as stairway lights on fence posts which is how I have them.  If the top one was the hidden one, it not only would be invisible (and the exposed lower one would be relatively out of sight), but you could just hang the light on it and it would make screwing in the lower one easier.  Or, even better, just slide and snap the light using the hidden top screw and make the lower one optional, allowing for easy unhook removal of the unit if you want.  Even better would be if the light could be attached to a symmetrical frame that works in either direction.<br /><br />That leads me to my second criticism...the switch.  If you want to change the mode, the switch is on the back and requires you to unscrew the light to change it.  Why not put the switch on the bottom where it's out of sight but yet still accessible without having to unscrew the lamp?<br /><br />Third criticism...battery replacement also requires undoing a lot of screws from the back. I wish battery covers were just snap-in. You could still have a snap-on cover that has a gasket to keep moisture out, but the 7 or so little screws seem like overkill.",neutral,positive

"The Wavlink N300 Wi-Fi Range Extender is a quick and easy way to extend your 2.4gHz network to reach the remote corners of your house.  It is easy to set up if you're familiar with normal router setup procedures (connect to its wifi or via ethernet cable, then access the router configuration through a browser).  It will normally create a wifi SSID that's different from your original wifi, but you can just force it to use the same name.<br /><br />For my phones and computers, I use my 5G wifi network but the older 2.4 Ghz is great for home automation products such as switches, doorbells, and cameras.  Keeping those devices separate from your main network will keep your main network running smoothly and free up a lot of IP addresses on that network.<br /><br />This device is very stable once it is set up.  My IOT devices have been able to communicate at a good speed and have not lost connections yet.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this extender did not automatically connect with my main router again when I rebooted it.  In fact, I was forced to reset the device and set it up all over again in order for it to work.  I can't say for sure that the problem is caused by this device or by my main router.  It's just my personal experience.  Perhaps test this functionality while you're still in your return period for the product.",neutral,positive
"I had looked forward to this purchase because of the many features. The extreme zoom, high mps, etc. But, thus far the camera has been a huge dissapointment. The menue is very lengthy and settings do not always do what they are supposed to. But, by far, the most inconvenient feature is that the camera is simply very hard to hold. No thought given to holding it. Close up focus is tricky and has given very poor picture quality. Flash is a problem, pictures often are very dark telling me the sync is off. This may need repair or replacment. I'm a former professional photographer and miss manual settings. This camera is supposed to have manual settings but those have not functioned properly. I give this item a very low rating and a 'do not buy' reccomendation.",negative,negative
"Glad I bought the 4 sections, the bird blinds I go to, have different height of portals to look out, it is critical, without a center post to be able to adjust the height of the tripod, 4 sections give me that option, if needed.  Using just 3 legs, with a Gimbal head, I have to bend slightly, at my 5/11 size, but lifting the Gimbal head vertically, just a bit, puts me at my eye level, or lowering the 2nd leg a bit to the pre-marked lines on each leg, which in my case is a perfect fit, and the leveling bubble was centered, wish they had more of these lines and numbered, on each leg, but I suppose one could create their own marks.  Serial number is located behind (rear) of the Gitzo lable on one of the legs, took me forever to locate this... Since I bought this on amazon, and not Gitzo, I was not able to successfully register the product at the external website you are referred, all it would say, after I registered on the site, and entered all my info, would not recognize the product number that is already listed in their list of product numbers, kept turning it RED, no explanation, it only told me that my GT5542LS had a 5 year warranty, but if you can register it, you get 7 years... maybe that is by design, or you don't need to register it?, but attempting registration was a major head-ache, as long as you have and keep all the numbers on the box, and the serial number that should be enough for any insurance company, if you want that option.  THE SERIAL NUMBER IS NOT ON THE BOX!, of all the numbers on the box, only the UPC number is labeled, good luck on the other numbers.  However, I've got a Tripod that will last me, basically, forever, and plenty of others that I accumulated on my journey to the Gitzo line, but they serve the lighter lenses just fine.  I placed old tripod along side my Gitzo, left Stabilization ON, used an external release cable, fired some test shots, and as usual my old tripod vibrated a lot, the Gitzo very little, turned off Stabilization, and used the LCD as the eye piece, to lock the mirror up and fired away, as usual I still had vibration from my old tripod, but no vibration from the Gitzo. This is what I expected, and the reason I bought this tripod, it is sturdy. I also ordered a 2nd plate for the top, as I will be interchanging between my camcorder and camera, loosen with the permanent built in 'wrench', push the button underneath, detach the plate with the Gimbal still attached, and insert the Camcorder quickly with its own plate, also ordered a wrap around velcro camo colored cover for the upper legs, and to protect from dings.

"I was really hesitant about buying a voice recorder. I thought about it years ago but thought it would be a waste to hear 2 hr lectures again, BUT with the ""T-Mark"" button which allows me to ""bookmark"" a part of the recording, I can easily skip through all of the other stuff to things I thought were important. I especially like that I can also place a T-Mark after the recording has been made and I have reviewed it. The sound quality is great on this recorder, and the Noise Cut is a great help when reviewing with ear buds. Especially since I tend to move a lot of paper around during lecture. I also really like that you can record in different folders, and you can come back to where you left off if you leave the recording. The speed control is also great in case the person said something too quick, you don't have to sit there and try to figure it out. Although I have yet to try it, I'm really looking forward to being able to transfer things onto my computer. I really like that this function is available, or you can also use a memory card for transfer. I like that it has a little ""stand"" attached to it so it does not have to lay flat as it is recording (reduces noise). The recorder also saves batteries by shutting down after about 1 minute of non use (not playing/recording/deleting). You can simply place it on hold if you need to step away for a small period to say for example take a quick phone call or bathroom break. Overall great product, lightweight, easy to use, and comes with a carrying bag. Although it is a bit on the higher side of the price scale for all of the recorders I looked at here on Amazon, it is well worth the investment if you plan to use it for a long period of time.<br /><br />*UPDATE*- Have been using this for about 6 months now with no problems. Sounds great when played back and has come in real handy after a LONG day of lectures in multiple classes. I sometime listen to it in the car instead of the radio. Also, if you ever find that you transfered one of the MP3 files to the computer and it's a 6 hour long file that you forgot to break up, there is a program I use called Slice Audio File Splitter. It is free to download on CNET. It lets you choose how many pieces you want the file broken down to or you can choose to break it down by any amount of time you choose. I use this for audiobooks as well that I listen to on my MP3 player. Hope this helps!",positive,positive

"This purchase is my third Fire tablet, went from 7""-8""-10"". I love the screen size, can't imagine going back to squinting at a smaller screen. It's a little heavier and noticably thicker than my everyday tablet (a Samsung 10"") but I'm okay with that. I bought it to be my dedicated device for Bible study, hoping it will last many years being used sparingly . Because of issues with a different device I started using it for my second account in a solitaire game I play also. That still keeps it about 10-15 hours a week total use. When I tap pretty much any feature in game instead of opening immediately like my main account on my main device, there is a lag of up to a minute before it opens that feature. Games I can play in about 30-45 seconds in main account take a couple minutes on the Fire, because of constant delays and graphics freezes (like, oh no a card is flying across the screen so I better do a blurry freeze for 20 seconds before I start gradually moving it out of the way so she can finally select another card). It's extremely irritating.<br /><br />But what I'm *REALLY* not okay with is a device that after one year of light usage has a battery that yesterday went from fully charged to dead at 0% in 34 minutes (see screenshot, 34 minutes on full battery)!! I had charging issues with my old 8"" so I made sure this time to only use the charger that came with the device, even though it's annoyingly short. I charged it overnight two nights ago and woke to 26%. Adjusted the cord and got it to 100%, then when I used it after half an hour it died because it hit 0%. The previous screen usage on a full battery totalled 1 hour and 22 minutes. Not good at all but not as pathetic as yesterday. And, as has been happening of late, it gave no low battery warnings -- probably because it seems to go from ~35% to dead in a couple minutes so it's totally skipping over that 20% benchmark warning time.  I guess I'll see what happens today when it's done fully charging. But no matter what I'm giving up on these devices. I'll stick with Samsung for now, because it's not perfect but I use this Galaxy Tab WAY too much and it's over twice as old but works like it always has.",negative,negative

"I bought this desk to use with my 17.3 inch laptop. While it fits on it, it is far from ergonomic. If I slide it over to the left, where the black mousepad is fully visible/useable, my laptop is hanging about inch over the left side of the desk. This also causes the entire keyboard to shift way to the left, which means your keys are no longer straight in front of you, and you're forced to type with your hands/arms extended to the left (not comfortable or ergonomic). This isn't too problematic for me, as my laptop has a touchpad mouse, so I don't need to use the mousepad. However, it would be a problem for anyone using an external mouse.  I had intended to use the phone slot on the top right, but when I shift my laptop to the right, so the keys are aligned in front of me for typing, my laptop then blocks most of the slot, so there's nowhere left for my phone. I tried setting it on what's left of  mousepad area (there's about a third leftover, that isn't covered by my laptop), but then the my phone keeps sliding off, since the desktop is angled down, and there is no stopper/lip there.  The stopper/lip that is on the desk towards the middle, the one that is intended to stop your laptop from sliding off, is so small/skinny that it's nearly useless. My laptop would slide right over it and off the desk if it didn't have rubber grippers on the bottom preventing it from doing so. All-and-all, this laptop desk is poorly thought out and designed, to the point that it lacks all the functionality that it would/should otherwise have.",negative,negative

"As a professional in the television and film industries, I'm pretty demanding. The machines I have in the house are all professional level decks. So when they started to age and I knew that I would eventually have to replace one of both, I started researching what was out there to replace my old Panasonic DVD Player/VHS combo decks (I have two and had a dead Panny DVD Recorder/VHS combo in a third room).<br /><br />All sources I checked lead to the Magnavox MDR515H/F7 500GB HDD and DVD-R with Digital Tuner. I was already a member of the AVS forum so I checked out their massive amount of resources on various decks and found their incredible board on this deck. It helped me make up my mind on my purchase.<br /><br />I bought the deck along with an HDMI cable and a box of Sony DVD-RW discs, which came highly rated. The cable and discs came within a couple of days and the deck about a week later.<br /><br />Now being a professional in the biz and working around very expensive high level gear, you'd think I'd be a pro at setting up home video gear. Nope. I'm just like everyone else. So do be informed that this deck has so much in it, you will have to pre-read the manual front to back before setup, and maybe a few times to get the feel of it.<br /><br />After you use it for a while, you'll see that it is actually very well thought out and somewhat intuitive, though there are a few functions that you're just going to have to break down and read the manual BEFORE you try to make them work. I keep the manual right with the deck just in case. Through repeated use and practice, you'll eventually learn how all the functions work. Man, does this device have a lot in it!<br /><br />Now, to my set up. First, be sure to check out the AVS forum online. The members there got me through a difficult start as I'll describe.<br /><br />Initially, everything started out fine and I was having a great time putting the deck through it's paces. But then, while I was trying to use a feature that let's you change the title of something you recorded, the deck locked up on me. I had read that this deck on rare occasion can lock up and on even rarer occasion, you have to take it back to the store and have another shipped to you. I did buy the extended ""no questions asked"" warranty for this deck.<br /><br />But after going to the AVS forum, the friendly members there advised me to first, pull the power and let it sit overnight, which I did. Then they said to hold the power button in and then plug the power cable in while still holding in the power button until the ""On"" indicator showed in the display. I did this and the machine came back to normal and I've been using it daily ever since without a hiccup.<br /><br />I won't repeat all of it's features as you can read about those in the product description and in others' reviews. And it does have a few very minor quirks as well as features they just couldn't put in the deck or it's software (such as the TvGuide scheduler for auto recording programming) but that is nitpicking.<br /><br />So trust the word of a professional, if you need to replace that old, dying VHS or combo deck, and you don't want to go with a Tivo, this IS the deck to consider! We will be getting another one right away for the other bedroom and maybe a third for the den!<br /><br />UPDATE: Since I wrote this review, we have changed cable TV suppliers to Verizon FIOS. This deck's tuner will not tune or receive FIOS so I had to go to a plan that supplied us with a whole house DVR. Since FIOS uses dedicated set top boxes, I can still use this deck. I pre-tune my room's set top box to a channel and then set this DVR's timer to start and stop at the beginning and ending of a show, using the line outputs of the set top box to feed the line inputs of this DVR. And/or I can record on the FIOS DVR and then play that program back through my room's set top box at a later time, dubbing the show onto this DVR for archiving or the making of a DVD.<br /><br />I thought readers would want to know that certain all digital cable systems will not allow this DVR to be used as a digital tuner and recorder.",positive,positive
It took 2 of us to put this together! One had to hold it while the other screwed the screws in. After trying to put this thing together the last screw would not screw in! Surely there are easier ones to put together than this! It seems sturdy but considering it’s unusable due to the large screw getting stuck I can’t give this item a positive review. Now I have to try and remove this screw to ship it back. Trust the reviews. It’s obscenely difficult to put together for no apparent reason.,negative,negative

"I bought this reader to replace an older reader. Overall I like it, but this reader makes it MUCH more difficult to move books around from one file (library) to another.

"I had limited expectations for a device that cost under $100, but the Fire HD 8 still underwhelmed me.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment was the paltry list of apps Amazon offers.  I knew that Fires are slaved to Amazon, but I did not realize just how limited the app selection was:<br />*  They're missing most of the security and communication apps I use on my phone, including Snapchat, 1Password, WhatsApp, and Tunnelbear.  That makes it much harder to keep in touch or use secure passwords.  It will also hamper web browsing and communication when I'm in China, trying to dodge the Great Firewall via VPN.<br />*  No Google products - no Inbox for Gmail, no Google Drive, no Google Maps app, no Chrome browser, no Google Translate.  That keeps you from accessing the content Google integrates across devices, including the docs, pics, and spreadsheets I have on Drive. When I travel, I can't use a downloaded language (e.g., Mandarin or Dutch) for fast, data-free access like I can with the Google Translate app.<br />*  Even the game content is oddly limited.  Some popular games are here, but there are some notable (to me at least) exceptions, e.g., Crashlands, Baldur's Gate, Oceanhorn, and NY Times Crossword.<br /><br />You can get easy access to Amazon content, of course, including Kindle, Audible, and Prime video.  It's easy to shop on Amazon, too.<br /><br />Even if you buy a Fire solely to read, watch, and listen to Amazon content, this may not be the best choice because battery life is poor (say 75% that of my ancient iPad 2) and it takes a L O O O N G time to charge.  Forget it if you intend to watch videos on a long flight and can't plug in at your seat.",negative,negative

"Horrible customer service btw. I contacted them twice, once because the tv keeps losing it's wi-fi connection and the other time because the flimsy lightweight stand it comes with broke after a month. Don't move the tv too much to clean or anything, the stand can't handle the weight of the monitor. Anyway, they sent me to some parts websites they found and the stand costs almost $90 to buy (they won't replace it).<br /><br />Image quality is good for cartoons/animations but terrible for anything else. It's grainy and blurry.<br /><br />Stand is too bendy for the weight of the tv, It seems to buckle a little when the tv is moved or turned. Mine broke after about a month while I was cleaning.<br /><br />Amazon isn't connected yet. They advertise the icon, but pay attention to the description. They expect to connect with Amazon in the future.<br /><br />Wi-fi connection shows as &#34;strong&#34; but frequently goes out (even though it says it's a strong connection, don't rely on that). We have to unplug and wait a minute and restart too often.<br /><br />Netflix app is not reliable either. It works half the time, but the other half, it goes out. And I know it's not Netflix because I can connect on other devices with no problems. Again, unplug and restart to &#34;reset&#34; the connection to Netflix.<br /><br />Customer service is rude and nobody I spoke with or chatted with online seems to care about the customer at all. In fact they blame the customer for anything that goes wrong. The people I dealt with spoke down to me and made me feel like I didn't deserve their help, blamed me for the wi-fi connection, the broken stand, and made me feel like I was wasting their time.<br /><br />Other than that, the tv is ok. I'm not going to say I'm impressed based on the price. I work hard for my money and if the company advertises high quality, I expect high quality, no matter how much it costs. False advertising is a bad practice, and we're conditioned to expect less all the time. But my time and money is worth every penny, so $350 may be cheaper than other products, but I value my money and expect things to work as expected, as advertised, and nothing less.",negative,negative

"I completely overloaded this unit and it performed admirably.  Mine didn't overheat even after 24 hours of continuous work.<br /><br />I asked it to balance a 500 watt-hour battery, a 12S LifePO4 at 36V.  Naturally, the unit only handles 6S, so I had to do it in two halves, but still, the battery is huge (15Ah).  It took about 24 hours before the unit decided that one half of the battery is now balanced, and it didn't even get all that hot.  The battery went from 3.2v-3.4v (0.2v) difference, which is massive for a LIFE battery, to a 0.004v difference.  My pack probably has a low quality BMS, and without this little guy my e-bike range eventually went from 35 miles to 5 miles.<br /><br />I didn't do much else with it, but the balance function works without overheating.  No complaints, and for the price I could get two just to do things faster.",positive,positive

So, I keep the black drive in the black case as a back-up and blue one for travel. Wish I could find a case like this for a laptop. Other aluminum lap top cases are much to bulky. Query: Why is it that we wanted smaller and and lighter laptops? It only seems to have resulted in having to carry multiple peripherals thereby defeating the purpose of a smaller and lighter laptop.",positive,positive

"While this Vixia camcorder has a lot of features to speak of, it can mostly be boiled down to one word: Waterproof. If you are shooting video in bad weather conditions, weather resistant cameras often just do not cut it. You need something that could actually survive underwater and take a minor spill if necessary. These are the conditions where this new camcorder shines.<br /><br />Once you delve into the specs you will see that this camera is really being marketed at the same consumer market that the GoPro already rules. It's main attribute is it's resistance to bad weather and conditions. Unlike the GoPro this camera does not have a lot of mounting options though, other than being ready to use on a tripod. The stabilization feature and small form factor make it perfect for handheld use. I don't see  a lot of secnarios where you would be using a tripod with it though.<br /><br />The image quality is decent, but not remarkable. You can shoot video in full HD quality, but there is no 4K video available. Stills are limited to 2 MP, which is about what you can get from a $30 flip phone. The most outstanding feature it has in regards to image quality is it's 40x optical zoom, which allows you to get great close-ups at significant range.<br /><br />The display is tiny, but very easy to see and navigate. It seems to feature a very fast processor, which makes moving through the menu options a breeze. The included instruction manual is pretty thin. Other than the basics, there isn't much information there. The built-in battery is a bit of a disappointment, only giving about 2 hours of video before it dies. There is no ability to swap battery packs, which is likely a trade-off for being waterproof. Charging can be done via a special USB adapter that comes with the camera. It does not seem to be a standard micro-usb or USB-C type of connector, yet it does plug into any standard cellphone charger, which is a bit odd. It also comes with a standard AC charger.<br /><br />Being waterproof, most of the jacks and connectors are behind a sealed door and you have to push a slider button to access them. This also helps to keep dust and dirt out of the camera as well. I really, really like the smooth zoom on this camera. The motor is absolutely noiseless, unless you actually put your ear to the camera in a quiet room. The zoom is very swift and reliable though.<br /><br />The price point is very decent considering the fact that it is waterproof. This is definitely not a camcorder built for professional use. It can take drops from a few feet, but nothing like professional cameras do. I would not call it's video anything like broadcast quality either. It's mostly for fun while on vacations where you don't want to have to worry about the camera getting bumped around or getting wet. It's perfect for letting the children use and run around with. Definitely a great pick for those situations.",positive,positive

"I bought this case because my iPad would be protected all around the edges. I used it for 3 days and here are my findings:<br />1. The case is so cheaply made and flimsy that it will not stand securely when inserted into the tab in the back. Once I would get it to stand without falling I could not touch it or it would fall again.<br />2. The sleep/wake magnet would only properly connect about 25% of the time. The front cover would not align properly when closed leaving me to fiddle with it until it aligned properly.<br />3. And WORST of all: I have a white iPad and if I did not have a screen protector on the front it would be all over. Because of the case wrapped around the front completely, the black on the inside actually rubbed off onto the screen protector leaving black stains on all four corners! I could not even imagine what my iPad would look like if I did not have the screen protector on!<br />I returned it immediately and went back to my Griffin IntelliCase. Granted, the back does not cover all the edges of the iPad, but the front secures and it has a hard back that stand up well.",negative,positive

My only complaint is that for some reason I can never seem to hit the pack space key without a couple of tries.  Never had that problem with other keyboards.

"This is the worst Blu-ray Player I have purchased.  This player stopped working after about a month.  I called customer support and spent over an hour on the phone to get it replaced or fixed since it was still under warranty. I had to call back again a few days later because the customer service person never sent me the information I needed to send the player (at my cost) to be fixed.  It was determined that it could not be fixed and that Sony would send me a new replacement player.  2 months later the replacement player shows up on my doorstep.  I get the new player all hooked up and now, a few months later, the exact same thing has happened. I think they refurbished and sent me back my old player.  I am getting the same error message about removing the child lock, and then the player goes black and will not display anything no matter what button I push.

"I bought this frame for my office after I had given the wooden model frame to my wife for Christmas.  Both are really nice and easy to use.

The picture is bright and the OS/Interface is not that hard to use once you are used to it.  About a 10 minute learning curve.  We have had no problems and give this frame an unqualified recommendation.  The only thing I could possibly be unhappy about is Amazon's ""dynamic"" pricing policy.

"I saw this item in the military sales store and I thought it looked cool. It is an ereader, MP3 player and a video player. I only wanted an ereader with a better screen that my Sony Touch PRS600. The Sony Touch would have been excellent except for the terrible screen. This device is so much bighter and easier on the eyes. If only setup and installation of apps and ebooks were as easy,...<br /><br />First, I must say I am computer savvy and I know how to set up new devices. This is not anything like an iPad, which some people seem to have issues with. I do not believe this device was meant to compete in that market. This is considerably less expensive and, therefore, we are getting what we paid for.<br /><br />I really only wanted an ereader, but I did test the MP3 player. It has good sound through the headphones, and the speakers are not bad for a small device. The video player plays well, but I was not expecting it to be as good as my iTouch.<br /><br />One con with this device is there is not much on board storage. It advertises 2GB, but the instruction guide admits there is really only 1GB accessible by the user for storage of media. I downloaded the Kindle for Android app and began to rebuild my library. I have so many books and I will max out the internal storage very soon. One way to make room on board is to drag and drop items from the internal storage to the SD card. Thankfully, it accepts up to an 8GB card (It may accept a larger card but mine is 8GB). That turns the con into a pro because I will certainly need the space.<br /><br />My touch screen is responsive. If I don't want fingerprints smudging the screen, I can use my fingernail. Although the instruction guide does not mention the stylus, it does come with a small one. If anyone can tell me where I am supposed to store it, I would appreciate it. Right now I leave it at home for fear of losing it. I have another that has a cord so I can hang it on the edge of the slip case, which is quite sturdy and will protect the screen well.<br /><br />I set up my Adobe Digital Editions account in my PC and activated the device after it was recognized by the software. That was pretty easy to do. I store all my pdf books on the SD card. It requires an additional steps of accessing my books through the Explorer app/SD card/digital editions. The Sony lists all documents or lists directly on the first screen.<br /><br />The device has a Wi-Fi locater which works well. I went to several local free hot spots and the device detected them quickly. It does get a little quirky if you move from hot spot to hot spot because it has to locate and remember each spot.<br /><br />I watched some reviews on YouTube and I think my device must be an updated version. The ebook pages turn quickly and the page auto flip function is a nice display. It is almost like turning a paper page.<br /><br />The preloaded photos and ebooks are standard. The ebooks are 25 free classics you can get just about anywhere online. The preloaded photos are okay and I can add my own to store. There are three classical music clips to demonstrate the sound. The preloaded video is a marketing tool, okay for checking the screen clarity.<br /><br />The battery life is fine if Wi-fi is turned off when not in use. Keeping Wi-fi on will drain the battery quickly.<br /><br />One complaint was that it was heavy for an ereader. I believe the heft comes from the slip case. The device itself is very light.<br /><br />Overall, I like this device, considering it was half the price of the Sony Touch ereader and has many more functions to include Internet connectivity. Although I still prefer my Apple iTouch for watching videos and listening to music, I like the option of loading other media on board, just in case. Recommended for those who want something inexpensive and smaller than a netbook or iPad to fit inside purses or briefcases.",neutral,positive

"Updating review since I've had 4 switches get damaged due to the poor quality of these key caps. Basically, these keycaps will destroy your keyboard, and waste your time.<br /><br />See image, bottom left (numpad 1) is so damaged keycap can't even fit on anymore (it just wobbles on the top of the switch and is not secured at all), bottom center (numpad 2) is partially damaged, keycap can still stay on but it's loose and will probably become unusable shortly. Middle left (numpad 4) is shown for comparison, that one looks good as new. This is after using these keycaps for a month or so.<br /><br />Basically, these terrible keycaps cause damage to the switches they're mounted on, I'm not sure why but they do feel extremely tight when new so I guess it's just up to poor molding damaging the switch's plastic or something.<br /><br />I've been replacing the switches (requiring me to open up the keyboard and desolder/resolder a new one each time), so if you do buy these awful switches then make sure to also buy a soldering iron, replacement switches, a screwdriver with whatever size bits you'll need, solder, flux, etc, and plan to waste however long to fix the issues that continually come up due to these garbage keycaps.<br /><br />my original review<br />----<br /><br />These are okay. Notes and nitpicks<br />-the colors look sharp (I got the red and white and they look great although I imagine the white will get dirty quickly)<br />-the plastic feels a bit cheap (ex. It's not cut out of its molding cleanly and has some little bit of extra plastic on the top center).<br />-there is no crossbar available on the wider keys, so if you only have one switch on your keyboard they will not actuate cleanly unless your pressing from the exact center.<br />-the key caps mount on their switches very tightly. Not necessarily a bad thing just something to note. Much tighter than the key caps my keyboard came with. I'm actually a bit worried if I take them off then I might break the switches off<br />-the weighting on the key labels looks awful in spots. Most letters are printed in bold, which looks okay, but some letters are stylized in a certain way that doesn't jibe at all with the rest of the keys. They're less bold and just look like misprints or something. I also kind of think the lettering on the red keys should be white instead of black",negative,negative
"this is a nice looking little outdoor speaker.

Very disappointing.<br />the speaker unit solar panel works great, and keeps the speaker unit charged.

However, I have the unit on a back brick patio, and heavy rains sometimes cause water an inch deep. therefore, make sure you put the speaker where standing water can't get to it.<br />The little remote works OK, but watch out that you don't lose it.<br />The sound quality is fine for small gatherings. don't turn up the sound too high, or the speaker will crackle and the sound will distort. It is a single downfiring midrange speaker.<br />Overall, this item is pretty nice for a small outdoor speaker, but I would not pay over $150 for it. The quality of the sound is just not good enough.",neutral,positive

Apparently, Uniden is too cheap to offer a toll-free support number, and they want you to pay for the phone call. To add insult to injury, when I did finally call their pay support number, I had to wait twenty minutes for someone to answer. Simply pathetic. I would avoid this company. Apparently Uniden does not want to put any money towards customers, so why should customers pay for their phones?",negative,negative
"I've owned this camera for just about a month now after dropping my beloved and four-year old Sony Cybershot into the ocean.  I debated buying another Cybershot (it would be my third) but decided to go in for a little variety instead. My Cybershot sported a Zeiss lens (i'm a former film photography enthusiast). This Lumix sported a Leica lens and you can't really beat the price for a 10 megapixel, leica lens digital with some built in memory and i really wanted the wide angle lens (which is great, as is the image stabilization).  I also looked at the Olympus Stylus of the same size; however, the word ""proprietary"" was mentioned far too often in regards to the Stylus so in the end, I went with the Lumix instead.<br /><br />At this point, however, I'm a little disappointed - the Cybershot was much simpler to use. Dare I say it but there might just be TOO many options on this particular P&S. I honestly think I might have been better off sticking with an interface I was familiar with.<br /><br />As someone who's tested the usability of an interface more than once in her life (professionally) - I always found the Cybershot to be so simple I had no need whatsoever to view the manual (this has always been my #1 indicator of a good interface). Not so much with this one - I can't even figure out how to delete multiple images at once on here, or whether I have the option to manually set my shutter/aperture. In addition, since I am a photography enthusiast, I find some of the presets wanting and as of right now, I can't figure out how to tweak them to my own specifications.<br /><br />Perhaps it's time to change my tactics and resort to the manual.",neutral,positive
"The head unit actually does work reasonably well, notably for testing handheld and antenna at a TX power level of say 3-5W at around 3-4 wavelengths away, for 2M anyway.  At that distance, in order to get in the far field of the antenna under test, the sensitivity control of the head unit must be set to about 80-85%.  At 70cm wavelength, adjusting each antenna ear to about 6.8"" (half wavelength of 70cm), and at 5W and max sensitivity on the head unit, you'll still get enough needle movement to be somewhat useful.  I had to use a pair of Bino's to clearly see where the needle was moving at around 25ft away.<br /><br />The remote unit sends SO little DC voltage to the head unit that no matter what sensitivity you set on the head unit, you see zero response on the needle even at 5W at 2m or 70cm. Maybe if you blast away with 50W+, you may coax the remote to send something useful to the head unit. But for a handheld at 5W, the remote unit is USELESS.<br /><br />Also despite what the manual claims, holding the remote unit or head unit with your hand greatly affects the response from the meter. I recommend  getting a tripod and taping the head unit to the tripod with an arm to extend it a good 12"" as possibly from the tripod metal structures. Keep it about 25ft or so away from a 2M transmitter at 5W, start low with the sensitivity and keep keying up and adjust sensitivity to have the needle move into the sweet zone of the middle of the needle range. I stand back at the antenna, and use bino's to read the meter response more precisely than guessing by looking with the naked eye.",neutral,positive

"THE GOOD:<br />---------------<br />* Braid type shields are much more flexible than the traditional vinyl, or thick rubber cables.<br />* 48gbps, 8K ready, HDCP 2.2, etc.<br />* 15 ft, and gold contacts.<br />* Customer service top notch. I ""thought"" the cable a I got was defective, and they sent me another one no questions asked. More on this below.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* This is the most difficult cable I've ever experience. It is very fickle. I have reproduced this fickleness with many gadgets, not just one. So, I am fairly certain this isn't user error. Now the first cable I got wouldn't give me any signal between my HDMI switch and my PS5. I wanted to make sure the Switcher isn't the problem, so I tested it with my Nvidia Shied directly to my 4k projector. Still no signal. Took it upstairs to test between Fire TV cube and another Switcher upstairs, still no signal. So it is reasonable for me to think the HDMI cable is defective. I asked for a replacement, and the seller sent me one quickly. With this new cable, I tested it with the Fire TV cube and switcher upstairs, and I got a signal. Great! So I took this new cable, and went downstairs back to the original location I wanted to use it... Guess what, no signal! LOL! This confused me, perhaps I mixed up the old cable, so I tried that cable as well, and guess what... I got a signal! But now I'm dubious of these cables because I'm fairly certain I did not mix up the cables. In any case, I took this cable that I just recently received signal, took upstairs to confirm, and guess what... no signal! LOL! See, what I'm trying to do to eliminate all doubts is for the cable to get a signal both upstairs and downstairs. Ultimately, I realized the original cable that I asked for a replacement for, I guess, was never defective. It is just fickle, like the new replacement.<br /><br />Good customer service is why I won't rate this any lower than 3-Stars. I'm pretty tech savvy, and I've never had this much trouble with a cable. This might be a case of YMMV (your mileage may vary.)",neutral,positive
"I bought for the automobile charging option (and the bonus european adapter) and it was a good price for four 2500 mAh AA.  But would not buy again or recommend.  Prefer Eneloop or Amazon Basics (the white ones made in Japan only) and really like the flexibility and options on my high-end Opus BT-C2000 charger (2nd edition firmware).<br /><br />Update 3/13/14:  Dropping my rating from 4 stars to 1 star.  After only three and one-half weeks and LESS THAN TEN (10) charge/recharge cycles, the batteries come nowhere close to their advertised 2500 mAh capacity.  Although I did a couple complete discharge/recharge refresh cycles when I initially got them (as recommended by the experts like N. Lee the engineer) and again just now with my Opus BT-C2000 smart charger, the batteries topped out at a capacity of only 1723, 1872 and 1837 mAh on the three batteries I tried to charge today.  If it were a couple days earlier or the fact that this item only cost $10 bucks, I'd return the damn things.  Very poor performance after such a short time.  Batteries have never been overheated or overcharged or anything.  Not recommended.  I've decided I'm only buying Eneloop batteries from now on.  They are the best, and cost a little more, but they hold 75% of their charge for 5 years, which is important to me for the battery supply I keep on hand for emergency lighting.  Also, it's often recommended not to mix and match different brand NiMH batteries with different capacities in the same item, so having all one type will simplify that for me.  Just got 8 of the new 3rd generation ones (which reportedly aren't any better than the already excellent 2nd generation ones) for only $20 sold by Sanyo and fulfilled by Amazon Prime with free shipping.",negative,positive

"I bought one of these for $75 about 3 or 4 years ago. It worked well for the price. It's exactly the same, except is has a logo ""innax YT-5015"" instead of ""Frisby"". The sound has degenerated over that time, and now it's very bothersome to listen to. The center speaker started buzzing a bit, and now any time the subwoofer is on, it is a single-tone buzz/rumble that is very distracting. Of course, the reason it probably has dropped performance is that when the 1 Amp fuse burned out, I replaced it with a 5 amp fuse. I'm guessing the drivers blew out that way.<br /><br />For years this system did all right, so if you're on a tight budget, this makes a good choice, especially since the receiver is built right into the sub. You can adjust the front, center, rear, and sub channels individually with the remote and on the sub, which is nice. One downside is that there are 6 coax inputs, which means you'll be swapping RCA plugs every time you want to switch a sound source.<br /><br />One big downside was how bright the LEDs are. If you keep it next to the TV, the lights are almost blindingly bright, and  if you have a video projector like me, putting the sub on the wall opposite the screen still illuminates the entire image somewhat noticeably.<br /><br />One nice feature is that is has a standby mode, and the system looks pretty good and the construction is solid.<br /><br />I will not be buying this system again, because my there are some movies that demand full sound, like TRON legacy.",neutral,positive

"I use this monitor at work and for the money it gives a great picture. There are two things about it which I find annoying:<br /><br />1.

"In terms of sound quality, aesthetics, and usability, this stereo system is quite ideal, and for its price, it's one of the most attractive unit on the market.<br /><br />What I looked for initially and value is the ability for MP3 playback (even though I still haven't tried it) and separate trays for the discs so that I can swap them without disrupting current CD. It's a solid unit.<br /><br />Now for the issues: first of all, as mentioned by others, the CD trays are noisy. When starting up the stereo, the CD trays do unknown things for quite a long time (up to 10-15 seconds) for no apparent reason. My guess is that it's swapping discs, but this noisy process happens sometimes even if the CD you want to play was the last CD you played before restarting the unit. Also, if you accidentally pressed play when you wanted to eject, and soon press eject, the CD will take forever to come out.<br /><br />But the worst problems relate to the remote. One of the problems is that the power button works differently on the remote from the one on the unit. For the remote, the power button cannot turn the unit back on. You have to choose one of CD, tuner, Aux, or USB. This is annoying because you can't use the button to get back to where you started without remembering where you were and looking for that button on the remote.<br /><br />Also, and this has happened more often than desired, which should be never: the unit blatantly ignores the remote. This usually happens when the unit has been working for a while. I push a button on the remote, and the unit LED display shows that it received a signal from the remote, but it refuses to do anything. It is very frustrating.<br /><br />These are minor problems, I suppose, but it does lead one to question the quality of the product. It's just lucky that it's been minor so far. And yes, the FM antenna wires are awful. The clock and timer functions are not overly useful especially since the LED display is rather small so it's pretty illegible across a  bedroom.<br /><br />I have not tried the USB, and I have no intention to do so. The point of a stereo system is to leave your computer alone. It's easier to get a set of good computer speakers than getting into the trouble of hooking these things up.

"The new NETGEAR Nighthawk AX4 router is a decent router, but may not necessarily be much of an upgrade, depending on what type of router that you are currently using and what types of devices that you are using to connect to the Internet.<br /><br />First of all, there are really no technology upgrades with this device that have not been around for several years now, so unless you bought your last router 5+ years ago or bought a really, really cheap one last time around, you may not see much of an improvement with this device.<br /><br />The processor that this unit uses is nothing especially noteworthy. It is no faster at processing data than most routers selling for more than $75 over the past 5+ years. It's fastest wireless speeds can be achieved using the wi-fi AC standard, which has also been around for several years now. Nothing new there. Speeds on the wi-fi B, G and N standards are exactly the same as they have been over the past decade or so. Most electronics devices sold today (especially cheap electronics from China) still only use the wi-fi B, G and N standards, which means that this router will not be any faster than that 10 year old wi-fi N router that you bought a decade ago. So, don't get too excited about increasing your speed on most devices.<br /><br />Where this router does a good job is in new installations where you haven't used wi-fi before and do not really have any specific expectations. This router works as good or better than 90% of the wireless routers out there today and is a breeze to set up for first time installers. Where it doesn't stack up so well is on price compared to some of the cheaper brands like TP-Link that make products that work just as well, only at lower prices. Granted, you are not going to get much, if any, tech support on these cheaper routers, but they definitely give you the most bang for your buck.<br /><br />If price is no object, this is a fine wireless router. I would hesitate to recommend it to anyone as an ""upgrade"" to their existing router unless it is truly a dinosaur though. There just is not enough ""new and improved"" about this model to justify replacing most already decent routers out there.",neutral,positive
"Contrary to the pictures, there is absolutley no way to secure this camera to a flat panel monitor.  The clip is a useless joke that must be used as a stand.

It is certainly not true Plug and Play -- and it comes with no instructions -- so I had to research online to install it.  And the microphone is terrible.  Even with Windows mic settings at 100% I was never able to obtain more than 20% volume from this camera.  I had to return it.",negative,negative
"So maybe it's because this is a renewed unit, because I don't believe this is how the normal operation is for a well-functioning unit.

"Edit : Don't waste your time with this product.  Support is horrible, and all the useful features that came with non-membership has changed and now you have to pay a monthly fee.  Without paying additional membership, it's basically an expensive paperweight.<br /><br />I have run quite a few tests with this device, and found several issues.<br /><br />-  The largest issue, is that their back-end servers (Canary's servers) are not well equipped to handle the amount of traffic from all of its users.  During peak times when a alert notifications are triggered, anywhere between 4-7pm, you might receive the first notification anywhere from 5-30min after the alert is captured and sent from the device.  That defeats the purpose of catching potential criminals in the act, and being able to notify authorities in a timely manner to minimize loss of property and damage.  On average, during peak notification times, I would receive the first initial alert notification anywhere from 5-10 min after the device says it captured an event and sent the notification, and once I didn't receive the notification until 30min after the device says notification were sent.  I've also contacted Canary support, and apparently according to their engineers, the delays during these peak hours is typical.  I have run tests outside of these hours, and the notifications are sent quickly (30sec - 2min), but if their servers are busy, you can expect way longer than expected times to get notified.<br />-  When the device is powered off (even with the app setting for notification when power is lost is turned on), no notifications are sent.  Not sure why this one doesn't work.<br />-  Sometimes the auto away mode switching does not respond.  The device will recognize when I have either arrived, or left home through the app history, but the mode switching does not occur.  I then have to manually set the mode to the proper setting.  I have checked all the settings in the app and it is set to switch modes automatically.  Powering the unit off and on again seems to fix the issue, but I would be hard pressed to say that you could dependably rely on the automatic mode switching.<br /><br />Maybe one day the Canary team could hammer the bugs out, but until then, I'd wait on this device, or look at other options out there.<br /><br />tl;dr - notifications take too long to be received during peak hours, and system is not reliable.  System is also easily defeated by either cutting power, or conducting activities during peak times.",negative,negative

"I bought the predecessor to these back in Nov 2015. They were Bose Freestyle earbuds (blue and green) which are no longer made. I paid $116 for them. In March of 2016, all the plastic buttons on the inline controller began falling off. The last button to fall off was the start-stop-answer button. The earbuds continue to work but it's no longer possible to control an iPhone with the controller. I contacted Bose (item just out of warranty) and Bose offered to replace them with identical FS earbuds for $90 plus shipping and tax. That would be about what I paid for them initially.  So I bought these from Amazon for $99 with a 3-year warranty added for $13, as the controller doesn't seem redesigned and will likely fail once again. The earbuds--other than that flaw--performed well for my needs. I expect more from Bose, however.",negative,negative

This happens only on occasion and not in any way I've been able to predict. It might scroll down a few pages and then back a few lines, which is annoying but not horrible, but it might also scroll up a couple of pages after I just tried to scroll down a few lines. When I'm reading long passages of text this issue is huge because I keep losing my place. It does not matter if I have it on smooth scrolling or not. I've never had this with a mouse before and to have it happen with a well-known brand's pricey mouse so soon after purchasing it is vastly disappointing.

"First off, I got this when it was $99, so I'm basing the value I perceived I got from it on that price point.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about it but overall feel like it was worth it for the money. Here is what I did and didn't like.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Very small and light<br />-Great lightweight wireless keyboard<br />-You feed your cable boxes HDMI out into the Revue and then out of the Revue into your TV, taking up less HDMI inputs on the TV (I only have 3 on my TV) Also makes for less switching of inputs.<br />-It's nice to have access to regular internet<br />-Netflix works well<br />-It controls the cable box via an IR blaster very nicely. It's nice to be able to use the keyboard as a quasi-universal remote.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-While having access to the internet is nice the browser is slow and kind of clunky nothing like Chrome on my PC<br />-The HBO Go ""app"" isn't an app at all but a link to HBO's website. In theory you can watch it via the Revue, but in my experience it froze up every time I tried to watch something. I plugged away for a while, watching the entire 1st season of Game of Thrones as well as a fair amount of other shows, but frequently it would lock up and I would have to try again. Most times I could get it to work, but it wasn't uncommon for me to just have to give up on HBO for the night.<br />-Not a lot of useful apps available. I don't think this format was popular enough to tempt many developers into making content for it.<br /><br />Now that HBO Go and Netflix are both available on the Xbox, the Revue gets very little use in my house. If you don't have an xbox or don't have other options for accessing that content it might not be a bad choice.",neutral,positive

"I have these pods under my subwoofers with my main speakers on top, they are located next to my media console which houses my turntable. These pods prevent my turntable from having any issues associated with the vibration from my speakers and subwoofers. I do have wood floors so I purchased the Shepherd Hardware 3 inch grip adhesive non slip pads to protect them since I heard that these pods may eat away at the wood seal, so I figured better safe than sorry! It's a pain when I have to move my speakers because the pods are not stuck onto the subwoofers in any way, so I have to re position them each time which isn't the easiest with a 60+ pound subwoofer. I may try to glue them on or affix them in some other way in the future.<br /><br />***Update 09/21/16*** Pods are still going strong, I recently attempted to move them and come up with a solution to affix them to the bottom of my subwoofer, I contacted customer service via e-mail which was HORRIBLE and never found a solution but I did need to replace the Shepherd hardware 3 inch grip adhesive non slip pads that I had separating the pods from my wood floor. I opted for a different solution which seems to be working much better. &#34;SoftTouch Furniture Caster Cups with Carpeted Bottom for Hard Floor Surfaces (4 piece) - 4&#34; Round&#34; The rubber 3&#34; grips that I had under the pods before seemed to degrade and became a mess.

"I wanted an inexpensive sound bar that wouldn't take up much room, but would still sound decent at all ranges. That's why I went with the Hisense HS214 with the built-in subwoofer.<br /><br />The sound is as good as expected. It doesn't produce much bass, but enough to set it apart from those that don't have a subwoofer. This was actually a pretty big deal for me, because I didn't want much bass, but the lack of any is vastly inferior, imo.<br /><br />The voice clarity is good, but I'd still say that it's average, at best. I have trouble understanding the dialogue when watching TV and I think this will help, but I've seen other inexpensive sound bars that were better here. It has surround sound and I just want to say that the NEWS mode is far more tinney than expected. I think it's worse than my TV speaker in that regard and I find it disappointing, even though I likely wouldn't have used it anyhow.<br /><br />For some reason, Alexa recognized it and now shows it as an inactive device in my Alexa app. I don't think it actually works with Alexa, though, and it's not the first time I've had a device do that (i.e Alexa recognizes the device, but shows it as inactive and won't control it). I didn't expect it to work with Alexa and I'm not even sure what good it would do, so no big deal.<br /><br />My only big complaint is with the ""mounting kit"", which consists of two screws. I wouldn't even care, except that it won't sit flat against the wall using the screws, because the cords are in the way (and I tried). As far as I'm concerned, this is a design flaw and you'll need to buy a mount for it to sit flat or just place it on a counter top. I may attempt to correct this with some spacers, but I'll have to buy some, since none were included.<br /><br />Overall, I'm pleased with the Hisense HS214, but I expected a better mount from Hisense, even if it's just a couple of spacers. Advertising it with a ""mount kit"" is dishonest when it can't be mounted flat.<br /><br />*Almost forgot to add that it worked with the nice HDMI cable with my TV remote.

"This is a bit pricey, but it's rated for 15amps, well made, and has ample spacing for various wall wart power adapters.  1200 joules isn't a bad rating (though not great for hard core surge suppression--basically what you expect for the price).  The six foot cord is ample, and the included provisions to wrap the cord around it makes it all work well.  I use this in my shop area for various battery chargers for tools and whatnot.  Compared to the standard $5-10 cheap power strips, you get 15a 1875w ratings, ample spacing for plugs, nice robust build, and ability to nicely wrap the cable.  It's a fair tradeoff for $30 and recommended.",positive,positive
"I ordered 4 of these cables - they seem to be good quality, but the way that they're packaged is bad. The cable is rolled up as if on a spool, BUT there is NO SPOOL. Instead the cables are tied off by twist ties. This means that when you attempt to unroll & use the cable, it quickly becomes tangled up into a big ""furball"". I did not allow time to wrestle with the cable mess, so it really put me behind schedule about a half day. After some serious frustration I finally sat down and untangled the mess and re-rolled the wire up on some foam rubber. Then it's ok. Frankly I would have paid double not to have had to deal with this mess. I did not see any other reviews about this particular aspect of these cables and maybe there's some 'trick' to dealing with them, but I didn't see any option other than untangling them and rolling them back up on a makeshift spool so that as I'm fishing the cable through the attic it would unroll without tangling.",neutral,negative

"Bought these for wife who apparently has really small ear canals. Every wireless buds that come with 3 sized cushions bother her, even the smallest sized cushions.

The bigger part rests again the inside of your ear creating the resistance to stay inserted. This is what bothered wife and her itty bitty ears I guess. My more manly ears seem to be okay with this.<br /><br />I am keeping them since they sound good and are affordable backups to my primary jogging set as these will work great for flying (they passively block outside sound, my joggers allow ambient sound in).<br /><br />As far as functionality, my only complaint: it is hard to long touch skip-to-next-song, sometimes it volumes up or changes equalization setting.<br />-volume up/down is good<br />-3 sound equalizer settings are nice to quickly fix different sound sources<br />-- songs on phone can sound different than internet songs (youtube, spotify, etc) so this is easy to add/remove base without digging into phone settings.

The range is worthless if you do not have it in an open concept space, and wifi speeds are low.<br /><br />Update 2<br />Moved to a new house which is larger then the townhome I lived in before.

My Lynksys used to lock up when my wire or I backed up pictures to dropbox, with this router we can have multiple devices running at the same time without any issue.

"Amazon sent me two Belkin Tru Clearscreen guards for review, this one and their [[ASIN:B00604RZRQ Matte Screen Protector]] product. I can highly recommend the Matte guard, which matches my needs exactly. This Privacy screen, however, is only for people who value their privacy above all other usability needs.<br /><br />The color screens in Apple's iOS devices are designed to have wide viewing angles, and they look great at most angles making it easy to share with your friends and generally easy to use whether in your hand, docked, or laying on a table. This protector does a good job of ruining all that.  The screen appears dirty, dim and unusable at any angle not straight on, and covered with a light grid of what looks like pencil lines when looking straight on. Also, unlike the Matte, there is only one screen protector per box, so you might want to use this with an enclosing case that will protect the edges from pealing off.<br /><br />It's possible that this is exactly what you need. In which case, I can say that the protector is easily installed, went on without bubbles, and has a delightful light texture for your finger gestural enjoyment.<br /><br />I just think most people would be better served with the anti-glare protector.",neutral,positive

"The Fellowes Air Duster is a lifesaver for computers. While it won't help with viruses or adware, it does blow dirt and dust away from cooling vents and out of keyboards.<br /><br />Most air dusters are the same, and evaluating this one, then, is difficult.<br /><br />Most importantly, it works. It has the same pressure, and total air as the Office Depot or CompUSA product. The straw seems to be the same quality, stronger than the kind used for drinks.<br /><br />To clean your monitor or computer, turn them off, and spray air on, but across it. Blowing directly at them will only spray dust into the device.<br /><br />To clean your keyboard, turn it over, and give it a shake. Lean it at around 45 degrees, and the put the straw into the space between the keys at the top. Spray the air directly down, dragging the straw downward until you reach the end of the keyboard. Repeat from one end to the next, and don't forget the number pad. Shake the keyboard again, and clean up the crumbs and dust from your desk.<br /><br />Choosing the Fellowes version over another needs to be based on price, convenience, or brand allegiance. Ordering online, along with other office products, can save money or hassles. You won't find a better general office air duster.

"UPDATE:  The product comes with a ""Lifetime Warranty."" Ever since the 1960s, federal law in the US has held that a warranty must be called ""limited"" if it's not unconditional. Despite the lifetime warranty, I can't get the company to help me. The specific problem I'm having is not the issue so much as the company won't even reply to emails. The bottom line is that if the company won't stand by their product, I can't recommend it. That's especially true when they guarantee that they will stand by their product.<br />(end update)<br /><br />UPDATE 2: The listing is for 100 meters (about 328 feet) but the box in the picture says 300 feet. I didn't measure it, but it's rare that anybody would put more in the box than what the box says. (end update)<br /><br />The cable is good quality. The connectors work fine, but are not outstanding. I don't know how many microns of plating there are so I can't comment on that aspect of quality, but the little tabs had to be pulled back a trifle on a few of them to get them to stay in the jacks. Nevertheless, there is no problem with functionality.<br /><br />The tool is far better than I expected. It is not the one pictured (which is an absolute requirement of Amazon's) but I can't complain when I get something that's an improvement. I'd rate the tool excellent, except by the time I got all my cable installed, I could have used new blades. The crimping part is still excellent, and the blades are essentially small razor blades, but I have no idea where to get replacements. Also, if you are not getting the tool pictured, I can't tell you that you will get the same one I got.<br /><br />Most of the cable is now in the walls/attic/crawl space between walls and ceilings. I expect that it will hold up ""forever,"" meaning until a new standard renders the cable obsolete. If you need to go through an arduous task to install the cable, I'd recommend doing it in a way that will allow you to use this cable to pull the new cables when 1000Base-T becomes the floppy disk of its era. That way you won't curse yourself for not shelling out the money for CAT6, which might be equally obsolete or very cheap by the time I need to replace this cable.<br /><br />Here's a tip for those who are looking for ""flat cable"" that's easier to crimp: When you untwist the pairs to terminate them, you can give each pair an extra untwist or so to straighten them out under the end of the sheath. You can also pull the sheath 1/4 inch further back while holding the conductors, untwist until there and the sheath will go back in place when you let go. Then when you put the pairs into the connector, it will be less likely that they will jump around on you. Since the ends of the conductors are lined up parallel when they go into the connector, and since the sheath will take the shape of what's inside it, it will be as flat as you make the wires under the last quarter inch of sheath.",negative,positive

"I had a minor issue where my product was missing a large ear wing. Customer service was fast and friendly. As for the product, it's excellent for the most part. The battery life is as advertised, I generally get about eight hours which is just shy of my battery life needs. Audio quality is also excellent. I'm no audiophile but it holds up against wired earbuds.<br /><br />There are a couple really frustrating aspects of this device.  When you hit max volume it plays and annoying ding that is  overlays above your audio. This can ruin a song or force you to skip back on a podcast. It also fades in audio after you've paused an audio source. This is nice for music so you don't get surprised by unexpectedly loud audio. This does, however, become very frustrating when listening to podcasts and makes the headphones nearly unusable for any sort of audio/video editing.<br /><br />Overall, the size and portability are worth the smaller batter life and extra buttons you would get by buying a horseshoe shaped wireless earphones. The variety of ear tips and wings makes them fit like a glove, the clip that comes in the box means they'll never fall of, and the magnetic earbuds are excellent when you don't have them in your ear.",positive,positive
"This little monocular/camera has an unique design. Canon made lots of compromises to build it for this size and price. As with any gadget that is full of compromises, it is not for everyone.<br /><br />As the product description states, this camera has 2 optical lenses (nominally 100mm and 400mm equivalents) and one digital crop to 800mm. These are paired with a very small image sensor (1/3 inch) to get the camera down to this size. Because of the small sensor, the camera is really only usable in bright sunlight; image quality is mediocre to poor indoors or at night or even early or late in the day or on cloudy days when the sun is not strong. The 100mm and 400mm are fixed lenses, you cannot zoom to levels in between those 2 values.<br /><br />The viewfinder has pretty good brightness and resolution, but is somewhat small, so looking at it for long periods of time was uncomfortable to me, especially in lower-light situations when the image quality was not so great.<br /><br />The minimum focusing distance is 3 feet with the 100mm lens and a huge 15 feet with the 400mm lens. That makes this camera impractical for most closeup photography.<br /><br />Battery life is a mediocre 1 hour of screen-on time or about 150 photos. You have to beware of the time limit if you are using this device as a monocular. While you can recharge the device in the field via the USB-C port, that is awkward at best since you have to hold the fragile battery door open while recharging it.<br /><br />Those are the main limitations to this camera, so who is it really for? The 100mm and 400mm lenses are equivalent to about 4x and 16x zoom levels on a smartphone or point-and-shoot camera. The Canon camera has no wide angle lens, but if you are carrying a smartphone with you, you can use that for your wide angle camera. I believe today's top-of-the-line iPhone has a 2.5X optical telephoto lens, so the 4X and 16X lenses on this Canon are huge improvements if you like telephoto photography. Samsung and Pixel Android cameras are little better, but the Canon still beats them at 16X.<br /><br />I think this Canon camera is useful for casual photographers who want to take telephoto snapshots of wildlife, daytime sports, architecture, etc. This camera is small and lightweight enough to easily fit in a purse or coat pocket or even a big pants pocket and it takes better bright sunlight telephoto photos than most smartphones. The camera lets you wirelessly copy photos to your smartphone for editing and posting to social media.<br /><br />What are your other options? Companies like Sony and Panasonic sell good compact point-and-shoot cameras with 720mm telephoto lenses and better sensors than this Canon camera. These cameras are a little more expensive and a little heavier, but about the same semi-pocketable size as this Canon. Of course, interchangeable lens cameras like SLRs or APS mirrorless camera will let you mount huge expensive lenses that can take fantastic telephoto photos, but are usually too big and heavy to carry around if your primary purpose is not photography.<br /><br />I'm giving this camera 3.5 stars because of list of limitations is maybe too long for most people, but I think it does have its place for some people. I do wish they had used a bigger image sensor to improve the image quality and low-light ability, even if that meant making the camera a little bigger and heavier. Even many smartphones have bigger image sensors than this Canon camera.",neutral,positive
"The Kindle Paperwhite (KP) does that for which I purchased it: allows me to read in the dark or in low light.  That part of it is terrific.<br /><br />I'm not so crazy about other elements of it as compared to the Kindle 3rd Generation (a/k/a Kindle Keyboard) that I'm giving up.<br /><br />I don't like the touch screen to turn pages.  It often requires 2 or 3 taps of my finger before the page turns, and if I want to go back a page, I have to tap the left side of the screen, whereas the Kindle 3rdG with the page turn control buttons on either side allowed user to go ahead or back from either side with just a slight push. My thumbs were right there; never had to move my hand.<br /><br />The touch screen means you want to have clean hands to avoid a greasy screen.<br /><br />I don't like having to tap the top of the screen to open an option bar from which I can choose to go home.  With Kindle 3rdG, I pressed the home button on the bottom.<br /><br />Unlike the Kindle 3rdG, where the user presses a single button called menu and up it pops, with the KP one has to touch the top of the reading screen to open the option bar and then touch a 3-bar icon on the screen, at which point choices such as turning WiFi on and off can be accessed but only after pressing Settings.  With Kindle 3rdG, I can turn Wireless on and off at the main menu screen.<br /><br />I also don't like the way collections are alphabetized on the home page of KP instead of appearing in the order in which they were most recently accessed.  I have a collection titled ""Reading Now,"" but it appears on page 2 of the home page because it is in alphabetical order (I have a lot of collections) instead of being at the top of my collections. I worked around that by renaming the collection to start with the numeral 1 so it is now called 1 Reading Now.<br /><br />I've had Kindle Paperwhite for about a week and have had to charge it 2 times.  I've only done 4 to 5 hours of reading in that time, and when I'm done reading, I turn off the light. Right now the charge is down to just below 50% so charge #3 is coming up soon. Amazon claims a charge will last up to eight **weeks** even if the light is left on.  Can't prove that by me!<br /><br />Also, it does not come with a USB charger, which we all know, but nonetheless, that stinks.<br /><br />Am I glad I bought it?  Yes I am because of what I stated in the first paragraph. Not only is the light good but the characters are more defined and crisper.  Do I wish Kindle 3rdG was backlighted?  Very much so. I'd go back to it in a minute.<br /><br />By the way, I bought the cheaper KP that comes with ads and I don't even notice them.  They don't appear on any page being read and who cares what's on the non-reading screen.",neutral,positive

"EDIT-AFTER 4 Months - I still enjoy this. And I'm still big on sony products. But this is not there best....I really might get a roku after 4 months of using this. Sometimes it just quits during hulu. And the searches are a royal pain.<br /><br />First, Not sure about all the reviews. I was skeptical about buying this because of them.<br />Second, WE HAVE A FAST INTERNET CONNECTION. Charters 30mbs for $30 applys to this household.

"This GE Universal Remote Control with Roku or Fire TV Streaming Remote Compartment was quite a confusing listing until after I had read it and studied the images a few times. By then, I had already ordered it, thinking it was going to control both my TLC TV and Firestick. Instead, I learned it controls my TV, and just holds my Firestick control on the other side of the remote. But, after thinking about it, I thought, this could actually help keep me from always losing my remotes.<br />I have to say that setting it up with my TV was a breeze. I don't have cable, only a TLC Roku TV and a Firestick, so no need for all the numbers and other things on the remote. That's a lot of unused buttons...<br />Well, it would've been ok, if I didn't keep hitting the buttons on the TV side every time I am trying to use my Firestick remote on the other side. It is almost inevitable. Somehow, I always hit a button that takes me to my TLC TV's home screen and exits the Firestick app and, of course, the show I'm watching.<br />It is also very bulky to just control two devices, or even its purported four. It is actually huge compared to just having both remotes, which I really still have, but in a more complicated form. There are so many more buttons that I'll never use and so much real estate for such a device. Now, if it really did have the ability to control my Firestick built into the other side, that would probably make it more stable, I would think. <br />Bottom line, it is just not worth the money, to me, to use it with the ""two remotes"" feature. Especially, when you're always exiting the show you're watching by hitting a button on the TV side of the remote, when you're only trying to hit pause on the Firestick/Other remote side. I am disappointed in myself, but more so in this device. It could have actually worked out to be a benefit, but it is just a big hassle. It is not my favorite.",neutral,negative

"When I first ventured into the realm of DSLR photography I started with a camera, a lens, and a hand-me down bag [[ASIN:B00004TX6V Lowepro Nova 2 Camera Bag (Black)]].  At the time and for a while thereafter, I didn't really think much about bags, as I focus my finds on acquiring more and more lenses, a flash, and misc other gear.  I had outgrown my original lunch box style bag and the larger [[ASIN:B00013J8G8 Lowepro Nova 4 AW Camera Bag (Black)]] I had bought for my gear.  Once on a trip my wife was surprised to see 5 lenses in a big [[ASIN:B0007W1E4W Lowepro CompuTrekker Plus AW Camera Backpack (Black)]], and asked where they all come from!  Thankfully it was more of an inquisitive question than a statement of mistrust in my spending habits!  Alas that backpack proved a bit bulky, but it did work as a carry on, as it consolidated my PC and my camera gear in a package that could fit in most bins and under just about any plane seat.  I still lugged around one of my lunch box style bags for field use, even if they barely could fit everything in a weather induced pinch (where I couldn't count on my camera hanging around my neck).<br /><br />This all changed last December, when I took the plunge on the Bigma--[[ASIN:B003A6H2Y8 Sigma 50-500mm f/4.5-6.3 APO DG OS HSM SLD Ultra Telephoto Zoom Lens for Nikon Digital DSLR Camera]] This lens eclipsed even the optimistic abilities of my shoulder bags, and even challenged the bulky CompuTrekker.  It joined my upgraded camera ([[ASIN:B001ET5U92 Nikon D90 12.3MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)]]), [[ASIN:B002D2VSD6 Sigma 10-20mm f/3.5 EX DC HSM ELD SLD Aspherical Super Wide Angle Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras]], Tokina 28-80 f/2.8, and [[ASIN:B00015GYU4 Nikon SB-800 AF Speedlight for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras - Old Version]].  I picked up a [[ASIN:B000AEEXPO Domke 700-10D F-1X Little Bit Bigger Bag (Olive Drab)]], which I affectionately refer to Domke-Kong, and it comfortably swallowed all my gear!<br /><br />Alas I wanted something a bit more compact, and I tried this bag.  I know the Bigma is a lot to ask of any bag, and in a pinch (literally), it fits with hood reversed (better without) mounted on my D90 & grip (better without).  That's it as far as glass is concerned, and it doesn't quite wear well.  I didn't try the Baby Bjorn style position, as well I don't want to be that guy.  Alternatively, I did use it effectively with the Tokina 28-80 f/2.8 attached (hood reversed) in the top mount and the Sigma 10-20mm f/3.5 below (hood reversed), but not nice versa, which is an issue.  I consider that scenario a more realistic expectation, and that is why I gave this 3 stars (not the limited Bigma success).  Frankly this is a very limiting case for specific uses.  I'd strongly suggest trying this out in the field or being prepared to return this if going via Amazon.",neutral,positive

"Up front, I just needed a shower radio, so I can't speak to any of the Bluetooth features.<br /><br />I do like this unit.  The sound is good, and the reception is better than the old, class Conair unit I was replacing.  This could simply be because of the digital tuner (I live a major city, so there's a lot of station overlap).  So as a shower radio, it delivers.<br /><br />Physically, it's has a little bigger footprint than I like.  It would be fine if I could have gotten the suction cups to work (we have a material other than ceramic, so maybe that would have helped), but after the thing did a lovers leap onto the floor twice, I gave up and resigned it to a shelf (demoting the shampoo that once resided there).<br /><br />The problems with the unit are a mix of rigid behaviors, quirks, and flaws.  The problems start turning it on.  A quick press of the power button is not enough to turn it on, so you need to hold it briefly.  But like a game of Operation, &#34;Look Out!&#34;, because if you hold it too long, it just turns right back off.<br /><br />As I said, I only need the radio portion.  Unfortunately, this unit was designed with the Bluetoothers in mind.  It also has no memory space set aside for your previous use.  So after doing my touch-therapy to turn it on, I need to wait another second to press the radio button (and switching over takes another second or so).  Now that it's a radio, apologize to the person who may still be asleep, because it comes on at the same loud volume.  The volume is a frustration as well, because it doesn't go up/down like a dial, but in steps, so you're not going to get the Goldilocks level you were looking for.<br /><br />Last is the display.  Most of the reason I got this unit was for the digital tuning display, and having the time is nice, too.  I just wish the battery display was more reliable.  Sometimes it's there, sometime it's not.  Maybe there's a way to coax it onto the screen, but in re-reading the instructions, I still don't see it.  So it's kind of like having a bomb timer, where the explosion is a dead battery, and it keeps switching from the countdown to the temp randomly.  That said, when it does show up, I have been happy with the battery life (again, as a radio).<br /><br />I know these are picky things in some cases, and complaining about one second waits in some cases.  But to be fair, it's 7am, I'm naked, I'm half awake, and I just want to get clean and get breakfast, so I'm admittedly a bit temperamental.  All that said, I don't plan on parting with my unit.  Once it's up and running, it's doing exactly as I want, perfectly, and enough to live with the problems.<br /><br />None of these have been enough for me to",neutral,positive

"What I Liked:<br /><br />- Surprisingly good audio quality<br />- Audio levels were quite loud (in a silent room).  I had to turn the volume way down for it to be comfortable to fall asleep to.

That may not be the case for everyone as everyone has a different shaped nose and face...<br />- The battery only lasted about 11-12 hours.  If you dont turn it off (which isnt exactly easy to do when you wake up in the middle of the night and its dark...) you have to charge every day.<br />- My product shipped with no box or manuals, arrived in the Amazon box in just a plastic bag.  The product wasnt that hard to figure out, but some may find it annoying not having a manual.<br />- In anything but a cool to cold environment, the mask made me sweat around the eyes and forehead.<br />- The biggest issue of all (and this could be purely anecdotal) was that the mask gave me severe headaches after a few hours of wearing.  Headaches bad enough that I was experiencing headaches in my dreams... This happened three nights in a row so I stop using the mask.

See you in court Creative Labs !!<br /><br />(no wonder the company's revenues are falling like a stone this year !)<br /><br />For anyone considering buying one of these players - DON'T !!<br /><br />If you already own one of these dogs, send your complaints to Craig McHugh, President, Creative Labs Inc, 1901 McCarthy Boulevard, Milpitas, CA 95035<br /><br />Pros: Was easy to install software and setup player on a fast, state-of-the-art XP computer. Daughter had no complaints using the player.<br /><br />Cons: Extremely cheaply built (made in China, with sub-standard plastic).<br /><br />Complaints abound about broken on-off switches and joysticks.<br /><br />Creative thinks its responsibility ends after they sell the product - and acts like the player only has an expected useful life of 90 days. After 90 days, YOU get to pay shipping (both ways), a $ 25 technician fee, plus the cost of labor to repair the player - and expect to wait months to get it back.<br /><br />Also, FYI - the battery is not user servicable: You have to send the entire player back to the service center (figure about $ 75 - $ 85) to have a replacement battery installed when the current one dies (and it will within 1 - 3 years)<br /><br />UPDATE:  A small claims lawsuit filing did convince Creative Labs to settle... purchase price plus value of my wasted time and aggravation.",negative,positive

"I've been through numerous headsets from a variety of manufacturers and have found Plantronics to always be at or near the top of the bunch since I first used their Discovery headset.<br /><br />I've also had a few cheap Motorola headsets that sounded like a tornado when trying to talk over even the slight breeze from my car's air conditioner, so the Voyager Pro's ""WindSmart"" claim is something close to my heart.<br /><br />Not content to use it to talk over something as wimpy as an air conditioner, however, I decided to put the Voyager Pro to the test by fulfilling a tech fantasy of mine: holding a conversation while bombing down neighborhood hills on my bike!<br /><br />The result was a pleasant affirmation of the manufacturer's claims. While riding I could hold a conversation with the caller on the other end (despite riding in a strong wind)!<br /><br />Reportedly, the sound quality was ""okay"" in the midst of airflow, and there was never a problem understanding each other. My old headsets would have crapped out at the slightest puff of air!<br /><br />I wouldn't actually recommend using the Voyager Pro while biking since the headset could bounce off your ear with a big enough bump, and I doubt the unit is designed to withstand a lot of sweat or rain, but the fact that I could use it under such conditions is enough to make me a fan of the product.<br /><br />The normal audio quality is great, as usual for Plantronics, and the ""WindSmart"" technology works well.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed with this purchase.",positive,positive

"These are terrible. I have 2 sets, and they are just bad. The false alarms every hour, sometimes a few times an hour are ridiculous. Their AI programming thinks every moving leaf, every moving cloud shadow, every wind chime is a ""person detected!"".

They claim it's 1080p? In their dreams. Unless the person was 2 feet from the camera you wouldn't recognize them if they said hello to you the next day. And yes, I have adjusted the sensitivity, reset them, turned them off and on and deleted them and added them until I was blue in the face. I am very experienced with computers, wi-fi, pairing, etc. Just spend more and get a better home camera system.<br />Edited to lower the rating. We had a power outage. After the power was restored I physically had to go around and unplug the cameras and plug them back in to get them to restore and connect with my phone & Wi-Fi again.

"I have several optics. Binoculars, telescopes, spotter scopes.<br /><br />Pros:  the large lens size really pulls in the light. The larger eyepieces makes it easy to view.

This isn’t a strike really.

"I was hoping these would be better then what they are.. They look cool etc.. seems to be a very well made speaker..  I installed them in a 95 yj Jeep Wrangler.. If you have ever replaced Dash Speakers in a Jeep you know how difficult it can be! If you are changing out stock Speakers in any vehicle. DEFINITELY Study  and compare the Holes/Slots you are going to be using.. I needed the Outter slots and found the slots were off center to center by 1/8&#34; !! I had to use a Dreamal tool to make the slots bigger or other wise they would simply not fit!!  Save your self alot of headache and check the Pattern! Chances are it is not going to line up and you will have to modify it.. I taped off the other holes and slots so to to prevent from the studs going into the  wrong holes etc. Had to cut the corner off on the Passenger's side speaker..<br /> The year before I replaced the blown speakers in the Jeep's dash with some Kenwood KFC-4675C. Had no problem with lining up.. They sounded good,but a year later one started acting like it was going out..??  Still not certain if it was just the connection or the cheap Radio I bought off Amazon. The Polks were Marine Speakers and thought they would be better.. The Kenwoods were actually louder.. It is a wash out for me as to which brand sounds better.. ?? All I know is I don't want to change the speakers out again! What a pain in the butt!  Also I did not see any speaker wire with these speakers.. They did include clips for other Mounting options.  I hope they last.. It is not like I am pushing them with alot of power,but sometimes crank it up full blast.. It has only been a few weeks and it is like they are already sounding Blown at times?

Everything was a breeze.<br /><br />I also really like the look of the motherboard.  The gray-black design meshes well with the look of the heatsinks.  Most importantly, there are no ugly, plastic shrouds messing with my air circulation.  The beauty is in it's simplicity.  As far plug-ins go, it has everything I need.

Make sure not to hold it by the padded side because it will absorb the oil from your hands and pretty soon there are hand marks and it just looks gross.

"i agree with the other ppl that they are sooo difficult to set with such a tiny, crummy pot.  esp if u r trying to set to a lower voltage, like i was trying for 1.5V.  you touch the pot it would jump from 0.8 to 2 volts.  even w a nice jeweler screwdriver.  so not very settable for lower voltages anyway.  if your target is 5 V, or more, u may have better luck.  even worse than that tho is the output voltage can suddenly jump to a different value which can let out magic smoke from your circuit.  that's no good.  also these things claim hi efficiency.  not.  i was pulling 1 Amp at 1.5 Volts and could not even briefly touch the chip or magnetic.  considering how they are rated at at least 1.8 Amps, 3 A peak, that's pretty bad.  from all that heat out and small amount of power out that's like 50% efficient.",negative,positive

"You get what you pay for, obviously, this is a $4 mount (that's why it gets an extra star), however, it leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />First, my plastic didn't crack as some have stated, however, it seems like it could very easily. Do I trust it with a generic $40 flash indoors sitting in the corner... yes... with an Expensive Flash plus a softbox or umbrella outdoors moving around in the wind? Noooooooo...<br /><br />Second, there is some quality control issues. Of the two I ordered, both were missing tightening screws (although different ones). I was able to find some at a local hardware store... but that adds an extra $1 to the cost... plus my time.<br /><br />Third, there are some major design issues, specifically the mount on the bottom (pictured). It is most likely either too small or too big (take your pick) for your application, and the thumb screw is horrible. It is way to big to use a selfie stick or monopod, the little screw that sticks up from those can't be clamped down. Same with cheap stands. However, a generic extension rod (such as for painting or a broom handle) is much too large. I went to  several different stores before just buying a generic broom handle, then drilling out the hole to fit it. In the end, it worked, however, it looked super tacky, and I don't exactly trust a little tightening screw clamped into a $3 Department Store broom handle with a flash and huge softbox.....

It has its uses, but it's so awkward to press (the actual button is on the seam of the plastic and the metal) that it is 99% of the time easier to just do the thing the gesture was replacing. now, if the button had been under where your thumb rests naturally, this might have been in the pros category.<br />-the omission of side clicks on the scroll wheel.

"As always, Apple gets everything right except keyboards. If you're a software engineer, the post-2018 ""super thin"" keyboards with tiny arrow keys and a mis-placed touchbar ESC key are just awful: welcome to carpal tunnel land. This keyboard has a more traditional key sizing, spacing, and travel, as well as full sized arrow keys - which is great. But not everybody needs a full number pad, which makes this keyboard HUGE on a desk. What we really need is a good keyboard with full-sized arrow and ESC keys but without a number pad.

"Living my myself and not wanting to install/pay for a 'real' security system, I decided to give this a try.  It works perfectly for me.  The range is good and is very sensitive.  The only negative is that it does go thru a lot of batteries.  But when you think about it, even if it isn't activated, it's still monitoring so the battery is in use all the time.  It chirps when the battery needs to be replaced. similar to a smoke alarm.

The real problem is that there is absolutely nothing intuitive about the controls and programming.  The instructions are terrible.

"I bought this laptop on black Friday for $700 and I'm debating returning it because I've had quite a few issues. I'll start with the negative because I feel that's more important.<br />The sound is really terrible and tinny. I didn't expect much from laptop speakers, but my old android phone has much better audio. Im actually wondering if there is an issue with the speakers, it's so bad. Plan on using an external speaker whenever you play games or watch videos.<br /><br />The battery life is terrible. Running mid brightness on eco, I get about 2 hours of battery life. Again, I wonder if my unit is defective because most reviews talk about this laptop having a 6+ hour battery life. I don't even know how long it would run on max settings.<br />Keep getting random dings from windows and can't seem to stop it. Internet says it's faulty audio drivers but after a reinstall, it still makes random sounds every 10 minutes. Not sure it is related, but when I open Facebook, aaaallllll the messages open simultaneously. Which is bizzare. Stopped going on Facebook because of it<br /><br />Positives<br /><br />Okay, it's not all bad I promise. The unit is whisper quiet and hasn't gotten hot no matter how hard I push it.<br />It's fast. I've never had a computer as fast as this. Whether I'm playing games or video editing, or web design, it doesn't hesitate. I'm not a huge gamer, but it can run crysis with full mods on ultra settings and doesn't make so much as a light hum.<br /><br />Honestly, I'm debating returning this laptop. Your mileage may vary but it's been a headache for me since I bought it.",neutral,negative
It sounds good but I found that with the weather alert circuit on the siren setting the batteries run down in about a month.

"Yep, it's a very easy set-up, and to my surprise, I set this up and was recording the subject.  I played that recording again; it was nice, clear, This is something I was not able to do with the Logitech C310, but I like what it did.  The view appears just a tad grainy, and the voice slightly muffled, but it is workable.  You also have room for adjusting the views.<br /><br />What I like about is this is the ability to Record Video, and Take a Snapshot and play them out.<br /><br />Like most software setups, this one doesn't take much.  Stick it on top of the large screen and you have a clear shot of webcaming.  I used this while my person on the other end was using the Logitech.  The view I received is not as quality as Logitech, but if suffices.<br /><br />I cannot imagine myself using the visual effects.  I would classify them as strictly for the younger set, but that is what could entertain children and get them to use the Webcam more.  The visual effects kind of pop onto the pictures you have taken.  There are sound effects with voice.  There is quite a bit more you can do with this webcam.  Experiment.  ....Rizzo",neutral,positive
I'm hearing impaired and hate wearing my hearing aids for watching tv.<br />I followed the set up directions and charged them overnight before trying to use them. I was surprised at how comfortable these are. I could wear them for a whole evening without getting irritated by them. The sound quality is good and the adjustable volume control worked perfect. I did hear the click that others talked about every now & then. I don't think I hear very well in that soud range so it was not an issue for me.

"Just finished two dives with this pole and it was phenomenal.  Tried one with the extension shaft full of air and the other full of water.  The compression of the air-only shaft caused me to worry about the seal, so I went with water the second time.

"My son said these had terrible noise cancellation and he can not use them. They are basically like walking around with speakers on your head! He tried to use them at the library and people 30 feet away could hear what he was listening to! He often uses speakers to make calls on his phone too and that was not even possible.<br />They defeat the purpose of being headphones if they are simply speakers for all to hear.<br />He had to use cheap earbuds the library loaned him.<br />He said these grey and tan ones looked a bit girlish. I as a mom thought they were attractive. I think the tan may look a bit like light pink possibly and he said girls gave him compliments lol which may mean they are more to a girls liking. I got this color due to he is on the street a lot and can not be drawing attention to himself. He can not have red or blue gang colors which some of the others had even if it was in the cord. And the black ones had shiny chrome which is too much of an attention getter. So, I opted for the grey ones.<br />They are also bulky and if you are limited on space my son said they did not fit in his backpack well. One night he even gave them to me to take home since he needed room for more important items in his backpack. I told him to just put them on his neck. And he was not even interested.<br />So, I'd say they are a fail.",neutral,positive

"Got this because I heard it would fit a Sony RX100 which it doe's comfortably and I might add it even fits with my quick release plate from my Amazon lightweight tripod, which is a great thing.  I give it one star which is unfair because it deserves five, because if clipped on a belt it's just too bulky, can't wear it on you hip and expect to get a jacket and seatbelt on.  Which means this little tiny bag has to be used with a shoulder strap or put in a napsack or briefcase or something.  I find the strap no matter what won't stay on my shoulder, slides right off as soon as I move and I haven't tried it over my head yet, but think that might be the only way to strap carry this tiny pouch.  Plenty of extra room in it's pouch up front for batteries x2 or a few memory cards and a cable or charger if thin.  Just with my RX100 in it with quick release it's kind of heavy and the case feels like it should protect it from a decent fall I can't alltogether be sure like with my other sony cases for my other cameras, those I know will protect my cameras, kind of like they could have gone just a little thicker on the padding, but that's not my real concern, it should be fine for a four to five foot fall on concrete.  My big gripe like I said is that it's just not a belt loop bag because it's just a wee bit big and that bums me out the LCS-BDE is a perfect belt bag but just a little too small, aghh I give up for now, this one fits the RX100 pretty much perfectly and has room for accessories and I like is by Sony for my Sony, LOL.  It's a good bag, just shy of great, oh and the belt clip is a loop and then has a button, so you can button it on or arround belt or use the camera loop and feed the belt through loop, so you have a choice of how to wear it, remember belt button can unsnap and then an hour later wheres my camera so be aware of that.",positive,positive

"The first thing I did when I got these speakers was have my jaw drop to the floor and ask what made these speakers so utterly horrible. The cushions are nothing compared to the HD202s, which sell for 2 dollars more! The sound is nothing like the HD202s, which again, is for roughly the same price, and the feel of the headphones are very clumsy. There's two places where you have to move the headphones to get them to fit on your head, but the HD202s, only 1 place you have to adjust. The plug on the headphones were broken when I recieved them, but that doesn't affect the score. What affected the score was the high price for this quality a product coming from Sennheiser, and the pain I got from wearing it for 10 minutes.",neutral,negative

"I bought this mostly for my 3 year old grandchild to use when at my house, to keep her away from my iPad pro. I didn't expect it to equal the speed or quality of the iPad, and it doesn't. But at 90 days old the battery won't charge past 50% and takes a long time to get there. It's slooooow. I can start an app at the same time on my phone as the tablet - on the same wifi connection - the tablet takes 3 or more extra minutes to just load the app. The only thing I use it for it playing candy crush, it stutters and freezes. I would return it if it wasn't past the 30 day window. I bought an 8"" tablet of the same brand, my granddaughter took it home, I would have been happy to have another 8"" - it was a little slow, but not as slow as this 10' version that was more than twice as much, the 8"" was out of stock, so I went ahead and ordered the bigger one - BIG MISTAKE. Not worth the money I paid. Very disappointed.<br />Update: I have revised from 1 star to 3 - I contacted Amazon about the charging issue via chat, said they would connect me to a specialist, which was a phone call from IBM's frustrating phone tree, after finally reaching a human, explaining the issue, providing the serial number and model, giving all of my contact information, the agent tells me, that she can't help me, she actually only deals with Think Pads, and says she will transfer me to someone that can help, she did give me an number I could call back in case I got disconnected.  Next thing I know a new line rings, recorded messaged, we are sorry the number you called has been disconnected...AAARGHHH - I was busy and decided I would callback later. The chat from Amazon pops back back up and the agent asks if the specialist was able to help....tell him what happened and he says no worries I will reconnect you, my phone rings again and it's the same voice tree that I was previously connected to...so I hang up and call the phone number I was given, go through the entire process again, talked to someone at Lenovo, I am told it sounds like the charging port is bad, that the tablet will be replaced by Amazon, I am days outside of the 90 day window. She says that's okay, I will give you a case number, contact Amazon with it and they will send you replacement. I get the case number, give it to the Amazon chat agent, and am told they can't help me, as I am past the return window. SHOOT me NOW! So the chat agent says I will connect you again - New Lenovo agent, transfers me to their technical support - I give the guy my case number, he tells me you will have to send the table to us and they will repair it, which will take the transit time to them 10-14 business to fix it, and the transit time back...so I will be without the tablet for about a month...In the meantime, I get on the Lenovo website and find the troubleshooting section after following several instructions, I happen across the a setting on the tablet for the battery, IT SAYS, charging will shut off when you are 60% charged...WTH - why didn't the tech guy at Lenovo tell me to check that setting, being a predominately Apple user, I am not familiar enough with the Android platform to have known a setting like that even existed, and why would that be the default?? I turned that setting off, and the tablet now fully charges.<br />So the take away is, #1 the Lenovo support people are in the USA +1 star for that alone! #2 The tablet 4 gigs of Ram and 132gb of memory - runs slower than the 8"" Lenovo tablet I bought with 2 gigs of Ram and 32gb of memory - 1/2 the speed 1/4 of the memory, and better performance. The 8"" was $99 the 10"" was over $249 - I would have bought another 8"" but they have been out of stock for a long time.<br />- 3 stars for the poor performance, -1 star for the poor value. Don't waste your money on the ""faster/bigger"" version",negative,positive

Wife loves them!  Even in air they do get pretty loud.  Set up was easy. Kind of a bummer that they only accept mp3 or windoze audio files and that they do not come with a wall transformer.

That is the problem. They don't last. We went through 4 pair in 3 years. They way that they are constructed is such that with normal use.. the wire from the power side to the passive side breaks.

"This is my 4th new trent case over the years. The keyboard is the worse so far. It does not work well with my iPad pages app. The previous keyboards were great. I had the previous new trent model on my current iPad and loved it. This one however is very troublesome. To begin with the keyboard would not pair up. NT support could not fix the problem and requested that I return to amazon. The 2nd keyboard paired without any problem but the keys were double and triple spacing, slow to respond, etc. I returned it also! Now I’m on my 3rd. I honestly hate it! I called customer support 4 times. Of course they assured me that the problem was with my iPad settings and not the keyboard itself. I adjusted the setting per their instructions but the keyboard continues to double and triple space randomly, slow to respond, etc. This keyboard just doesn't work well. Makes typing miserable! If my old (New Trent) case hadn’t broken I would still be using it. I can still pair my old keyboard and it types wonderfully, so obviously the problem is not with my iPad. I also work for a large company who supplies my iPad with a dedicated iPad support department who’s required to ensure my iPad is functioning properly. Thumbs down on the keyboard. I use my keyboard all day in my job. If you want a keyboard for general use this might work well but not for extended typing typing (haha theres a double) on Apples pages app. The case appears to work very well and seems to be better than the previous models but not the keyboard.

"Sorry to say these are crap. The sound quality is only ok. I’d say they’re the modern-day-headphone equivalent of a shitty boom box. Does the trick in pinch. Noise cancellation is just okay. Disappointed since I’ve loved any JBL speaker I’ve ever used, but they need to rethink their headphones. Particularly any time you tap them to readjust how they’re sitting in your ear you accidentally pause the music or turn off noise cancellation. Not a big hinderance to use but can be annoying when your doing something like jogging or exercising. The way the buttons adjust to using just one headphone at a time sucks as well. If you have just the right one in the noise cancellation will automatically turn off. If you have just the left in you lose the pause play button. To add onto that they consistently paired with my phone at random times even when fully tucked into the case and closed. I’d put them away and hours later they’re pair to my phone and I’d have no idea I was getting messages. They also didn’t seem to be compatible with my windows laptop. I could only get the case but not the actual headphones to connect ..? Lastly they broke pretty quickly. The left ear bud no longer holds a charge at all no matter how many times I’ve tried readjusting it in the case and keeping the case plugged in. Def not buying again & wouldn’t recommend.",negative,negative

"If there were half stars I'd give this motherboard a solid 3.5 stars. I have very mixed feelings with it. It is a nice motherboard, and I still use it after a year. It works great now, but when I have had problems with it it has been a headache. My first issue started while trying to change my two hard drives to a mirrored raid configuration without losing my whole setup. Long story short while trying to recover from an image file I managed to break my BIOS. Then while trying to repair the BIOS the whole thing froze. All of that could be attributed to my bumbling attempts at computing, but after this this motherboard did me no favors. In the manual it claimed that a USB BIOS flashback card existed to repair the BIOS by the user at home. Well after some online research it turns out that it simply doesn't exist. As if ASUS had claimed it a feature and then never finished it. I think a slightly higher end motherboard would havehad a BIOS flashback button or switch that could have quickly solved my issue at home. I ended up having to disassemble my computer and send the board in to ASUS. I was very pleasantly surprised that it was fixed free of charge and after sending it on a Friday I got it back the next wednesday. I thought that turnaround was outstanding. It would have also been great to have onboard wifi but that was my fault for buying a lower tier model motherboard. All in all I like the board now. It was easy to build on and felt very quality. The heat syncs are sharp looking, and I never found myself short on fan headers or SATA ports. The white and black went really well with my build too. In the future I would buy ASUS again because of the excellent support I got, but I would spend more money on a higher level of motherboard than I did my first build with this one.",neutral,positive
"The motherboard is good.  But its supposed to be optane ready which it is is partly.  Also, Asus does not provide instructions with how to configure optane.  You have to go to Intel online and guess where to find the user guide to install and configure the BIOS, drivers, and software.  The box does not even tell you that when upgrading like I did, optane will not work if you are transferring your hard drive with Win 10 on it.  That is because Intel requires that CSM be disabled in the BIOS prior to install Win 10 from scratch.  So I have a board that I can't use optane with unless I reinstall windows and days worth of software not to mention a configuration nightmare that took a lot over time to get right.  Lastly, you have to remove the optane stick if you are in the same boat as me otherwise it degrades your hard drive performance.  And you have to revert all of the BIOS changes you made to get it to work.  Intel and its hardware partners like Asus REALLY NEED TO INFORM ITS BUYERS ABOUT THIS REQUIREMENT TO AVOID THIS SITUATION!",negative,positive

"I wanted to wait and use it a while before leaving a review.<br /><br />First off, it is larger than I expected it to be.  That's okay - just had to rearrange everything.<br />Secondly, it is a refurb, so there are limits as to what to expect.  My old computer had a hard drive die.<br />I got a new hard drive, but for some reason, it would never connect to the internet again after that.<br />I downloaded new drivers, etc etc, but nothing. So, couldn't really go without any longer, so looked for a refurb.<br /><br />I like sticking with HP because I've used them for years. I've even had refurbs.<br />This one is different.<br />First of all, it lays horizontally instead of like the towers I've always had.<br />It looks a little rough, but not unreasonable.<br /><br />it grunts at me while using it, much like my old dying hard drive did, so that does worry me a little bit.<br />It sounds like a grumpy old man who doesn't want to get out of his chair to reach the remote.<br />There are plenty of USB ports on this one.  It lacks some things I'd like to have, but hey...<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the lack of RAM memory on this. It only came with a measly 8GB.<br />That might sound okay, but it isn't.  Everything moves in slow-motion.  Copying files is a nightmare.<br />I can't afford to buy more memory right now, so I have to just suck it up.<br />We raided a couple of my other computers which are all HP, but of course, NONE of the six memory sticks I had<br />will fit this one. *bang head on desk*<br />The speakers are HORRIBLE. If you have ears, you'll want to replace them or add your own.<br />I do have speakers, but have not yet hooked them up, because it has to be done on the back, and I have to move<br />a lot of stuff to pull it back out enough.<br /><br />This also has Win10, which I dislike a great deal. Seems like everything was moved to a new place just because they could.<br />But I'll deal with that. Most of the time, I can ignore the Win10 junk.<br /><br />Overall, it will do what I hired it for, which was to get me back on the internet.<br />But if you work with graphics (like I do), know that the lack of memory will be sand in your shorts.<br />Everything takes much longer than on my old HP tower.",neutral,positive
"While I like the case (though I wish there were more colors to choose from beyond boring shades of blue and grey), the case works pretty well and goes on snugly.<br /><br />The 3-star review comes from the screen protector provided. I have put on many screen protectors on many devices, but I cannot get all the edge bubbles out of this one no matter what I do with the little bubble pusher provided. The screen cover only covers the square display on the player, so it has a thick edge around the screen that can get caught and pulled off. The sticky tab that is on the cover to help you apply it only came halfway off the screen protector and left sticky residue on it, so I had to use rubbing alcohol to scrub it off, which was no ideal.",neutral,positive

Also my power button often gets stuck in the off position and I have to jiggle it several times before it pops back out and will turn on again. Lastly, picking up a public wifi source (such as a hospital where I work) seems to be intermittent at best even with a signal strength of excellent.

"My experience (or lack of it!): After some Nikon School of Photography classes in the early 1970's I jumped into SLR's with a full range of Honeywell-Pentax cameras and lenses.<br />My first digital camera was the Canon 30D (8mp, no video and no sensor cleaning).<br />I tested a Nikon D800, Canon 5D MkIII and  Canon 7D. I kept the 7D.<br />I got manuals on all three from the same author, and was using high end Canon ""L"" wide and telephoto zoom lenses and Nikon ED high end lenses.<br /><br />Conclusions:<br />I loved the full frame sensor (35mm sized sensor) in both the D800 and 5D.<br />I saw no practical difference in photo quality between the D800's 36mp and the Canon's 22mp.<br />There was also no practical difference (if you're not enlarging to extreme sizes)between these two and the Canon 7D.<br />I love Canon's intuitive controls and that ""big wheel"" Quick Control Dial.<br />The Canon 7D's menu is very easy to read (there's never more in a particular ""tab"" than what will fit in the rear LCD (so you don't have to scroll down thru choices)<br />The 7D has a very useful built in flash (pop-up flash), that also can be used as a master flash (to control other ""slave"" flashes).<br />Both Canon's were faster at acquiring focus (I was using a Canon 70-200mm f/2.8L & Nikon 70-200 f/2.8 ED lens - both are $2,000 + lenses).<br />All three cameras have built in sensor cleaning (although in reality you will probably have to clean the sensor sooner or later).<br />The Nikon D800 and Canon 7D have pop up flashes. No Canon model higher than the 7D has one.<br />(This one item meant a lot to me because a pop up flash can be used to highlight during a ""daylight"" photo and you always have a flash with you, instead of having to lug a separate SpeedLite flash with you-even the small Canon 90EX or 270EX still needs separate batteries and fills your pocket).<br /><br />Negatives: 1.6x cropped sensor (although if you use a Canon 10-22mm EFS lens, it's the same focal width as the Canon 17-35mm L lens).<br /><br />I did not test the ""movie"" modes of each camera, as I am not experienced in that area, but all the cameras seemed to have very good quality video when displayed on a Sony 55"" LCD TV.<br /><br />Best positive was the price: I paid $1,149 on a special Amazon.com and Canon promotional period just last month.<br />The Nikon and Canon 5D's are around 2 1/2 times as expensive (body only).<br /><br />I don't think anyone could go wrong with either a Nikon or Canon, so Nikonians, please, no ""hate mail""!<br />Both are great camera companies. If I were a previous Nikon DSLR user, I may have went with the D800, but the Nikon D800 was just too confusing for me to try and learn a whole new way of adjusting & choosing options.<br />Menus take more time to scroll thru, but are fairly easy to use.<br />Dedicated buttons are quicker to access, but you have to learn and remember what each button does.<br />Canon uses more menu choices, while Nikon seemed to be on the ""button heavy"" side.<br /><br />Final word: Buy the best lenses you can afford. That extra weight in a Canon L lens, for instance, is because of the extra ""glass"". And the extra $$$ is for the expensive glass.",positive,positive

"I guess there is a price for low price and high capacities.  I picked this up at a store at the same price here plus a 10 buck rebate.  All other 16 GB flash drives were closer to 40 bucks.  I do believe PNY makes flash drive for HP, since I used a PNY rebate form.  I am going to compare speed with a 1 year old 2 GB ScanDisk's Cruzer.<br /><br />Speed, for small files with Vista:<br />I pasted or ""write"" 70mb onto the flash drive for HP at 3.5-4.5mb per second or around 4 on average.<br />The Scandisk did the same files at 7:57 to 7.55mb per second.  Both copy files from the flash to my computer at about the same 7.69mbs.<br /><br />Speed for larger files:<br />I dumped 3 gigbyte file onto the HP (photo files with a lot of folders) it took 26 minutes.  The Vista popup screen said 1.55-1.95mb per second.  I did the math myself and got 120mb per minute or 2mb per second.  I only dumped 1.2GB onto the smaller Scandisk and it took 8 minutes with the Vista screen showing 2.13 to 2.87mb per second.  I checked that with my math and got 157.2 mb per min or 2.62mb per second.  I also did a single large file and that went quicker on both flash drives.  The more sub-folder and individual files you have the slower the copy/read speed is.<br /><br />So overall if I had to move large files faster more often, I would look at a difference flash drive, since I don't, then this HP price and capacities will work fine for now.  Also I wished it had the retractable head, I think I lost the cap already.  One thing HP did well is it did not add any software like Scandisk did on their flash drive, which is useless.  The drive is also very compact like the Scandisk, I have seen other bulky drives out there.",neutral,negative

Having used the Slim (never seen the others), I have to say it is perfect for in the car, laying down in bed, on your lap while sitting.

"1st, I have the Kindle Fire HD 7"" with 32 GB of storage and ads enabled.<br /><br />If you are a book junkie, news junkie, or movie buff like me, then you will love the Kindle. You can carry around in your hand a whole library of large or small books and read them at your leisure, which can be just about anywhere. I think that aspect of it is great.<br /><br />There are also all kinds of games for it. I like a handful of the basic time-wasters, but otherwise I stay away from them.<br /><br />It does not have the basic card reader. It is designed with the idea that all of your storage will be on Amazon's Cloud Storage. Amazon gives you unlimited storage for the materials which you purchase from them, plus 5 GB for personal data. You can't transfer images from your favorite camera onto it, unless it has built-in WiFi (maybe). The Kindle is designed to rely only on it's built-in camera. I don't consider the built-in camera to be real great. Plus I consider the built-in camera awkward to use. It seems like the main idea of it is to take pictures of the user. Use with video calls and video conferencing would be ideal for it.<br /><br />Unlike the Netbooks, which were popular a couple of years ago, this tablet does not replace a computer in any sense of the word. You will still need a computer in addition to this tablet.<br /><br />Also, while I am on computer issues, Amazon's instructions say that this table will connect to any computer. This idea does not seem to be true with some computers and operating systems. My computer would be an example. The Kindle transfer system relies on the newest version of the Windows Media Player. I am running Windows 7-64 Premium on a 1 year old Toshiba. It has an AMD 64 bit processor and the 64 bit version of Windows 7. (Amazon and Microsoft both indicate that I am a minority with this choice.) I have the Windows Media Player on my computer. However, Microsoft gives me the message that the newest version of their Media Player will NOT run on my system. Apparently, my version of Windows Media Player is upgraded as far as Microsoft is going to upgrade it. (I never use it anyway.) It also appears that Kindle can not transfer files to my computer without the newest version. To get files from one computer to the other, it seems that I will have to email them to myself. (This is going to be a pain.)<br /><br />WiFi connections are problematic. That said, the Kindle version seems to be more problematic then most. I travel all over the USA. If you are in an area where there is a lot of WiFi routers, then the Kindle seems to get confused and refuses to work. Or you start running into security issues with everyone.<br /><br />I mentioned before that I am a movie buff. There is not room on it's internal storage to download a bunch of movies to it, and there is no external storage except on Amazon. I have even tried attaching an adapter and card reader card to it. This idea didn't work. Kindle won't recognize the card.<br /><br />I purchased a Bluetooth keyboard which works fine with it. But while I can pair up my computer to the Kindle with a Bluetooth connection, I still can not transfer files to/from my computer to the Kindle using it. (Don't know why, yet.)<br /><br />One thing that I have noticed is that this is a great idea to increase Amazon's business. I have purchased several apps and books from Amazon for it. Books are usually a lot cheaper to buy for use on Kindle. Apps are usually very cheap. And it is really nice to have a whole library to read at any given point where I have extra time. The built-in reader which reads books back to you is another great feature. I like have it read to me while I sit back and relax. (I am reminded of teachers asking me in high school if I was reading with my eyes closed and my head laying on the books.)<br /><br />Another issue that I have run into is the Kindle headphone-speaker plug. I am working trying to find out what works and what doesn't work with it. I have one set of headphones which will work with it, and they sound great. But most headphones and speakers won't work with it. The receiver socket of the plug-in area is recessed, and only a plug with an indented collar will make a connection. Standard speakers and headphones for other devices don't seem to work with it since their connecting plugs don't slide inside the socket far enough.<br /><br />The sound from the Kindle is great. The video is great. It is easy to read. There is a ton of things that you could do with it.<br />In short, the Kindle is a great idea. But it still needs work.<br /><br />Update: Sept 18, 2013<br /><br />I have ordered many things from Amazon using my Kindle Fire HD.<br />But it hit me that not all of the items available from Amazon will show up on the Kindle when browsing and placing orders. An example would be a jacket that I just received. I am a big person, and need big clothes. I ordered the largest size of a jacket that I liked using my Kindle Fire HD. It barely fits me. I looked at the jacket that I ordered on my home computer and saw that Amazon offers the jacket the next 2 sizes larger, and in additional colors. The additional larger sizes and colors where not showing on my Kindle when I placed the order.<br /><br />As I said before, the Kindle fine for reading books, magazines, and for a person's personal entertainment. In fact, it is great for that. But it does not replace a computer.",neutral,positive

The band is not quite long enough for large wrists - the half of the band with the buckle on it needs to be longer so it ends up more in the center of the wrist than on the side.  The other half of the band has enough length but it causes the buckly to be on the side of ones wrist.<br /><br />Adding to review.  The watch worked for a couple of months but now the dial light comes on randomly many times a day and during the night.  I tried contacting the company and get replies to do things that I had explained I had already done before contacting them.  It appears that the replies are simply a sequence of answers that have been prepared and sent when I send in a reply myself.  Eligibility for return to Amazon has passed so looks like I am screwed with a watch that is not working even though it is supposedly warranted for a year.  I have had it for 5 months.  Customer service from the company is unresponsive to issue so I suggest not purchasing products from ANDFZ.,negative,positive

"The case over provides decent protection front and back for normal use. The cut outs for the buttons and camera allow for easy access. The front magnetic cover is excellent and remains closed, as well as stays propped up when folded up. However, my gripe is with the rear backing of the case. I'm not too sure if it's the light blue color I purchased specifically, but it is quickly wearing down. I received this iPad case a little less than two months ago, but have noticed that the plastic backing of the case is slowly coming apart. The paint is peeling off revealing the transparent plastic. The edges that keep the back cover on the case is chipping away. My use for this iPad is that it goes in and out of my messenger bag, and propped on a table. I have no dropped the iPad with the case on. Overall it is a decent case, but there needs to be improvement on the back plastic cover.",neutral,positive
Similar to the Sansa Disk Headphones but these are larger and not as comfortable.

"I loved this clock/radio!  That is until half the LED lighting failed after 20 months. This unit sat on a bedside table (out of the sun) the entire time I've had it. I used the product manual to do a ""reset"" but this didn't work. I called Sangean customer service and they walked me through the reset (I found out I did it correctly myself). Customer service rep suggested I take out the back-up batteries and perform another reset. This did not solve the problem. We tried the reset several more times, including unplugging the power cord in between two resets. As there is only a 1 year warranty he let me know I could send it in for repair for a cost of $40 + shipping. That's over 1/2 the cost of a brand new one.  I don't think so. Guess I'll be looking for another brand of clock/radio. One more note, I'm 59 years old and have only owned three clock radios. Neither of the first two cost nearly as much as the Sangean RCR-20, yet neither had any problems, I simply replaced them with better sounding products. They each lasted over 15 years!",negative,positive

Not having owned a of Bluetooth headset before, I can see now that I probably purchased the wrong product.  Controls for the various functions are spread out along the neck harness and makes it difficult to remember which button/slider does what. You end up having to take the harness from around your neck to determine which control you are after. Also some functions don't seem to work or work poorly such as the Equalizer, Battery Status Alert.  The Bluetooth range is good.",neutral,negative
"I like to have the apple tv use my homepod for audio output. However, every day I must manually go into the settings and then switch the audio source to my homepod. EVERY DAY or sometimes twice a day.  Why can't it remember my selection? Honestly this is quite a hassle. Also, I cannot control the tv volume. It will not work with my tv. Unlike nvidia shield, which allows you to control the volume ON THE BOX itself, the apple tv can not do this because it assumes it will be able to successfully control all tvs via IR.  So, if I have to keep reconnecting the audio source and can't control the volume, most of the convenience of a tv box is gone. The remote is nice, I will say that much. Oh, one more gripe, when I travel or stay in another country and have to use a custom dns server to be able to view the content I paid for being a US citizen, this box tends to mess up a lot. For example I have to be really careful to access prime video by not going through the apple tv portal and instead by opening the app itself, otherwise it will say 'content is blocked'. And even then sometimes I will watch one episode, then I try to watch another episode of the same tv series, and it says 'title not available in this location'. Then I have to reboot the apple tv, and only sometimes does it work.<br /><br />With the nvidia shield, it allows me to control the volume via the box itself and it never messes up once I input my custom dns information while watching outside USA. In short, the apple tv box seems to have dementia, and I'm surprised an apple product is this buggy, usually the main selling point of apple products are they just work but not in this case.  I got the nvidia shield tv and all of my problems went away, I can control the volume and watch shows I paid for outside the usa.",negative,positive

"Pro: NetDumaOS is very powerful router OS for the gaming enthusiast, specially if your internet connection is not super fast: It has a very good QoS that allows to tune your bandwidth. Thumbs up!<br />Cons: Hardware is very old (it is exactly the same hardware you will find in the Netgear X4S R7800). The R7800 is a fantastic router but it was released in 2016 and it shows its age. The UI of the XR500 is slow, sometimes it freezes..it just doesn't feel fluid. If you have a fast internet connection (fiber), the router will limit your speeds, specially if you are running QoS.  If you are not a pro gamer then you are way better off by buying the X4S R7800 model which can be found cheaper (used) and the firmware, the community support of the R7800 is fantastic.

Before I realized that it was defective, I tried to plug in the various electronics that I planned to use with it.  Granted, I have a wide transformer.  It used up its entire space and partially blocked the first regular outlet next to it.  I could have lived with that.  However, the other outlets are too close together.  I could not plug in my laptop's AC cord and my photocopier next to each other.  I tried to leave an empty outlet between them in order to plug in a normal lamp, and it did not fit between them.

"I’ve owned this bag for about six months to see how it would age and it has only gotten better with time. Upon receiving it, it had a very strong odor so I placed it in my living room on a daily basis against a wall and the color bled onto the wall. It was a simple clean up but it was still frustrating because it happened for weeks and I let it happen because I didn’t want it to happen to my carpet. The stench and bleeding stopped and the bag lost a very small amount of structure which is great. I get compliments on it everyday. The only issue I have now is that the front zipper always gets stuck when I open the bag fully. Had to give it three stars because I love the bag and I feel like it will last forever, but it is a bit of a hassle after purchase.",neutral,positive
"The picture is good, the interface is nice. It runs Android, and includes an APK loader which I used to install VLC.<br /><br />The MAJOR downside is that you CANNOT use it to stream video from a laptop or other device. The special cable it needs is simply unavailable. It also has no internet connection, so you won't be able to use it for more android-y things without manual intervention. Theoretically, you could set up ""reverse tethering"" on a PC to provide it an internet connection, but I haven't personally tried it.<br /><br />It seems like the use-case for this is when you have video files (or presentations I suppose) and are willing to copy them to its memory.<br /><br />Be sure to get a MicroSD card to put in it, as the 2gb of built-in storage is pretty tight for storing video.<br /><br />Also, the possible picture size is limited by its ability to focus.

I got around this by using 2 mice (1 connected to each PC) and then only switching the keyboard between the two.<br /><br />2) Sometimes there is a very noticeable (long) delay when switching between the devices.  This is also a big disappointment.  I suppose this is for battery life, but I would MUCH rather have fast response than long battery life.<br /><br />Other than that, I like it very much.

"I purchased this dash cam set to replace a front-only dash cam I currently have. So far I'm extremely satisfied with the performance of the camera and the video quality. The video quality is slightly improved from my previous cam from a few years ago. This one has a number of additional features including speed and GPS displayed on the video.<br /><br />The biggest benefit I've had with this particular camera is the mounting style. I've used a few previous dash cams that were mounted via suction and hung down. For many cars (mine included), though, the area that you would want to mount the front cam is behind the rear-view mirror. A suction won't stick in this location due to the sun-blocking paint there. This camera's mounting is done via sticky 3M pads, which allows it to be mounted there. Also, the streamlined design has the video screen integrated into the angled body of the camera. In short, it's a lot more compact than others I have used.<br /><br />PROs...<br />-Ease of setup: Setup couldn't have been easier. I used a micro-SD card that I already had, and was able to re-format it within the dash cam's menu system. After that, the cam immediately worked as expected.<br />-Adjustable lens angle: My previous cam had the lens fixed with the body of the cam. To adjust it, the entire camera had to be moved. This front cam has a fully pivoting lens to allow the lens to be adjusted separately from the body.<br />-Simple menu setup: I found the menus to be very straight-forward.<br />-Lit up buttons: My previous cam had a similar set of buttons, but they were smaller and located on the sides. This front cam has the buttons in view and lit up, which is important if needed to lock an even video quickly.<br /><br />CONs:<br />-Cords coming out of left side: This may just be my preference, but the power/rear cords come out the left side of the camera body. Since I have them run toward the passenger seat, they have to curl over. Not a big deal, but I'd prefer them on the other side.<br />-Multi-use buttons: The front cam has a set of 5 buttons for navigating through the menus. Depending on which menu or mode you're in, the meaning of the buttons can change. They are shown on the screen (a positive), but it takes a while to get use to them without looking each time.",positive,positive

"I have a love-hate relationship with bose headphones.  I owned the over ear headphones, but the ear padding started flaking off and leaving black stuff in my hair, ears and face after a year.  The two in ear headphones I've owned fell apart at the earbuds but still worked.  Only after the wires failed at the split on one pair and the input jack on the other pair did they stop playing music.<br /><br />My point here is that bose headphones are not durable.  2 year lifespan max for me.  I do use them about 3-4 days a week, so I am a heavy user.  However for the price, sucks.  If you need them for daily use, be prepared for them to fall apart.  Great sound though.

"I have only been using the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 (128 GB) for a few days, but so far I am very impressed! The screen is excellent, the S Pen features are (surprisingly) useful, it's very speedy, and the Edge Panel is awesome for setting up multiple multi-tasking scenarios.<br /><br />The only area I am a little disappointed in is the wireless Dex capabilities. I was really looking forward to using my 65"" TV as a display (via Xbox's Remote Display app). However, it is basically unusable with a bluetooth mouse & keyboard. The mouse is extremely ""floaty"". If you turn off Dex and just project the Android interface the mouse is still floaty but you can focus on your tablet's screen and not look up (useful for others watching your screen).<br /><br />I use primarily Microsoft and Amazon apps, so they all scale well on this 11"" screen.

"I've been slowly adding smarthome devices, and adding a video doorbell has been on my list for a while. With a family of 5 that frequently has visitors, this was a must for us. Installation was easy and so far the experience has been worth it! For $100 during the holidays, this is a steal! Refurbished products are sometimes just returned, open-box items that go through testing and maybe an outer shell replacement to look like new again. The package was sealed and no way could I tell a difference! Worked as expected, but here are some thoughts about the product itself...<br /><br />Before installation, you need to verify you have a transformer that's outputting a strong enough voltage. For the Ring Pro, the company recommends at least 16v, and you can use any cheap multimeter/voltmeter to measure it if you can't find a label. For me, I simply had to lift the cover off of my wall-mounted door chime to see the transformer. I measured it there, but the easiest way to measure is at the doorbell itself. Remove the screws and tilt so you can access the back side. You'll have two wires going into leads. Doesn't matter which one you select as positive and negative when you measure. Fortunately, mine was outputting 19v.<br /><br />Once you've verified, the rest of the process is pretty straight forward. A nice step-by-step guide comes packaged with the device, but Amazon also has an online tutorial and there are countless YouTube videos if you need visual guidance.<br /><br />For me, the most frustrating part was connecting to Wi-Fi. It will work with a 5GHz signal, but your 5GHz Wi-Fi network must allow 802.11n (Wireless N) connectivity. I only have that available on my 2.4GHz band, so at first I couldn't get it to connect until I figured that out. Generally, 2.4 GHz is better for penetrating walls and other obstacles, but any device connected to 2.4 GHz is more likely to run into congestion, especially if you have a lot of smarthome devices sharing that band (or neighbors that live really close to you). You may have to try both depending on your situation to see what works best. On the 2.4 GHz band, I'm usually getting -55 for the RSSI reading, and Ring recommends a minimum of -60 (higher is better, so -55 is better than -60). Optimally, you want this number in the -40s or better.<br /><br />So that's probably my biggest gripe. Because mine is hovering close to the minimum, video occasionally pauses during a recording or looks choppy. I'd say that happens on 1 out of every 5 videos. I can live with it for now, but I'll need to get a better signal to the front door eventually. Any other gripes? Probably the fact that you have to eventually pay to keep videos accessible in the cloud. Since I plan to add other cameras in the near future, I chose the ""Plus"" protection plan for $100/year, which allows you to connect an unlimited number of devices. Even at $8.34/month, that seems a bit steep if you ask me. $5/mo would have been more reasonable.<br /><br />As for other features, I love the fact that the Pro version gives you the option to customize your motion zone, and even add multiple zones with different sensitivities. Very helpful in reducing the number of alerts you receive. Ring also records audio and video at both ends, meaning I can hear what I'm saying as well as the visitor when I play back an ""answered ring"". Not every competitor does this, though more and more products on the market are beginning to add this feature.  I also like the 1080p resolution, and the night vision is respectable for such a small device. I can't make out objects very far off at night, but it meets expectations and often exceeds them. In the box, you also get faceplates in multiple colors, allowing you to better match your door trim if you so choose.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Conclusion:<br />This is a must have! After a lot of research, reading/watching comparisons online, it seems the Ring Pro is still leading the pack, even if only by a hair. In a future version of the Ring Pro, I would like to see an option to schedule live recording. Say I want to record uninterrupted between 11pm - 5am, I should be able to. It would also be nice if Ring offered more mounting accessories, like an extension bracket that would allow my Ring to get past the brick that's partially blocking my view (as shown in my pic). Currently, the only real accessories online are being offered by 3rd-party suppliers, and nothing that solves my issue.<br /><br />In the end, don't hesitate to choose Ring over the competition, and refurbished is a good way to save some money!",positive,positive

"I spent a long time looking for the right battery (10 vs 10pp) and AC charger for my zs200. Camera store had none. online was confusing. Panasonic was useless. they told me 10 and 10pp were not interchangeable when their pkg on a battery had both numbers on it. They also wanted pop before emailing me an answer of what ac charger would work.<br />I took a chance on this one based on reviews and was confused when I pulled out a kit  with a plug, battery, battery holder and a usb to connect it all. The manual had a different name for pkg than the box (which is the right one I thought).  Returned and paid more to order exact same box for more $ from Adorama, which was promised to be right, but it was the same. I don't understand. The advertised photos everywhere I go online is NOT what is inside. I don't want a 3 piece charger. I want one that plugs into the wall directly. Even the pics show the items looking different than what is in the box. This one does NOT have a fold out plug. It goes into the wall, has a usb to a 'holder' that the battery goes in. I have researched for weeks without an answer.  When people review  this and say it has a fold out plug, they are getting something different than these 'travel packs'.<br /><br />Update: I called the store where I got my camera (a ways to drive for this) and had the salesman take the box off the shelf and open it.

I liked this case when I bought it three months ago. Although I never got the “sleep” mode to work. My iPad always stayed on even when I closed the cover. What I don’t like is: after three months (as you can see by the photos) The finish of the case is starting to come off. I didn’t know what these black pieces of fake plastic were that were on my floor and then I realized it was coming off the case. I can’t recommend this case at all especially if you have to replace it in three months! there’s no durability. Very disappointing and a waste of money.,negative,negative

Any notes I take will sync to all my devices. When handwriting notes, I use GOODNOTES 5.<br /><br />In class or at home. Sometimes I am using my iPad, MacBook and phone simultaneously. This device allows you to link 3 devices to the keyboard and you can toggle between devices very quickly.<br /><br />FEATURES I LOVE ABOUT THIS KEYBOARD:<br />- It’s easy to pair<br />- It’s EXTREAMLY easy to toggle between devices.<br />- Battery life is GREAT!<br />- Small and compact size is great for travel.

Originally i was going to get a portable blu ray player to use on my flights and trips around the world but i found it to not meet my requirements.  so i return that and then when hunting for a tablet.  it was hard to find one in this size with decent resolution cpu and ram for a good price believe it or not!<br /><br />i probably look at 10 different tablet before settling on this one due to the higher resolution support and larger screen size and faster CPU.<br />it also has slimport HDMI support for plugging in to a TV to watch movie play game or netflix.  it also support USB OTG  so you can connect a ps3 controller (with required usb adapter) with the app sixaxis to play games!  this tablet can also take micro sd cards up to 2TB (when available) or 200gb sd card currently.

"Made the mount of my a7r a little more solid.  There is still slight rotational movement, but i won't knock the product for that since even my pro canons have some movement.  Just a warning to others...make sure you don't strip the screws.  I wish Fotodiox came with warnings/instructions.  I did watch the installation video beforehand, but there was no mention of the screws Sony uses as having loctite.  2 out of 4 of my screws almost got stripped and when finally removed, there seemed to be a decent amount of red thread locker on there.  What I finally did to remove those last two screws was cover the mount with tape to protect the sensor and heated the screws with a lighter for a few seconds.  Do this at your own risk, but this was the only way I was able to break them loose.  The last issue and the one that bugs me the most was that it threw off infinity focus for my manual lenses.  I read in other reviews for the older tough mount that some weren't able to focus at infinity.  I'm wondering if this led Fotodiox to machine the LT mounts thinner. All three of my lenses now focus past infinity...so although not a limitation, it is rather annoying I can't trust my lenses to be in focus for landscapes and distant subjects without using the viewfinder to confirm focus.  This was tested with my Nokton 35/1.4, Summilux 50 asph, and summicron 28/2 asph.  All three lenses focused at infinity perfectly at their hard stops with the stock Sony mount.",neutral,positive

"I bought this because I was traveling abroad and I wanted to backup my phone pictures.  If my phone got lost or stolen on the last day of the trip, I would lose all my pictures from the entire trip.  It's definitely better to backup your pictures each evening so they most you could ever lose would be the pictures from 1 day.  You would still have the rest.<br /><br />This is mostly just an issue when traveling abroad.  Back home where WiFi is common, the iCloud backup is just fine.  Unless you take zillions of pictures, you can even use your cell data to backup your pictures when there's no WiFi (assuming you have a reasonable data plan).  However, when traveling abroad or on a cruise, access to the cloud can be quite expensive and/or limited.  That's where this device comes in handy.  Backup your pictures without WiFi or cell data.<br /><br />There is another reason why you might want this device.  If you take tons of pictures on your phone, then space can be a problem.  You might be running out of space on your phone and/or the cloud.  Or maybe you don't have an iCloud account at all.  You want to make room on your phone, but you also want to keep all the pictures.  You can copy your pictures to this device, and delete them off the phone to make room for more pictures.<br /><br />The concept of backup up pictures from your phone is a good one, but I don't think this device is the best way to do it.  I just bought the RAVPower FileHub wireless travel router, SD card reader, USB portable drive companion.  I think that's going to end up being a better solution than this device.<br /><br />There are a couple of things I don't like about this device:<br />1) The drive is very wide.  If you have two USB ports that are close to each other, the drive will block the other port.<br />2) I find the connection to the iPhone to be awkward.  The lightning connector on the device is on the end of this flexible rubber arm on the side of the device.  You bend this arm away from the device (but not too far, per the warning in the instructions), and plug it into the phone.  It's hard to describe, but you end up with this thing at an awkward angle hanging off the bottom of the phone.  You wouldn't want to put it in your pocket like that, and it sits funny on the table since both the phone and the device are at an angle.  If you flip the device around, you can get the phone to lay flat on the table, but then the device is blocking the home button.  It's a really goofy design.<br />3) This last one takes a while to explain.  There is a sync mode, where you can automatically sync the device with your phone.  This will save any new pictures from your phone onto the drive.  Here's how it works: You run the app, plug the device into the lightning connector, and run the sync.  Pictures are copied to a folder on the drive that you specify.  Since you create the folder originally, and you associate the phone's sync with that folder, you can use the device with multiple phones.  Simply use a different folder for each phone.  When you sync, any new pictures on the phone which aren't already in the sync folder will be copied to the drive.  The concept is very good.<br /><br />However, one huge drawback of the sync is that the file named aren't preserved.  For example, if you just copy a picture off your phone using some other method, you'll get something like &#34;IMG_2841&#34;.  That's an easy name to deal with, if you want to do something with a particular picture (e.g. Bob wants a copy of IMG_1531, or I want to print an 8x10 of IMG_2316).<br /><br />Unfortunately, when you use the sync method, the file names are not preserved.  The picture files get really long names with a seemingly random string of characters.  I'm sure the names mean something to the sync program, but for a human they just look like random garbage.  In any case, your drive ends up with this sync folder filled with hundreds (or thousands) of files with random unreadable names.  If you want to do anything with the files, you'll wish they had more recognizable names.<br /><br />Let's say for example that you copied IMG_1000 and IMG_1001 off your phone using some other method, and later you decide you also want IMG_1002.  Well, you know that the picture must be in the sync folder, but good luck finding it.  You wish you could just sort by name and grab IMG_1002 directly, but since the names are all random you'll need to scroll through hundreds (or thousands) of thumbnails and try to figure out which picture was originally called IMG_1002.<br /><br />Because of this issue, I think the sync mode is useless.<br /><br />However, you can still back up your pictures in a semi-manual way.  The trick is that if you do a manual copy to get a picture from the phone onto the drive, then the original file name is preserved.  So, instead of doing the sync, use the manual copy mode.  This isn't quite as tedious as it sounds because the app understands the problem with duplicate file names, and it gives you the opportunity to deal with them.<br /><br />Here's what you do.  Set up a folder on the drive where you want to backup your phone's pictures.  Using the app, select all the pictures on the phone and copy them to this folder.  Let's say you have 500 pictures.  The copy will take a while, but you will eventually have all 500 pictures in that folder on the drive.  Then a few days later, you want to backup your newer pictures, but you aren't sure exactly which ones are new.  Do the same thing you did originally.  Using the app, select all the pictures on the phone, and tell the app to copy them to that same folder.  After thinking about it for a while, it will tell you that you have selected 541 pictures to copy, but 500 of them have duplicate file names.  It will ask you what you want to do about that.  Select the &#34;skip&#34; option, and any file with a duplicate file name won't get copied.  In this example, it will only copy the 41 pictures that weren't there before.<br /><br />This works, but it's still not great.  It takes a while to analyze the files before starting the copy.  Let's say you had 1000 pictures originally, and you only took 2 new ones.  The backup should be fast, right?  Well, no.  It takes the app a surprisingly long time to analyze the 1002 pictures and figure out that 1000 of them have duplicate file names.  Eventually, it will tell you about the 1000 duplicates and you can select &#34;skip&#34;.  Then it will copy only the 2 new pictures.  But even though there were only two new pictures, the process takes a frustratingly long time.<br /><br />If you know exactly which pictures are new, and there aren't very many, you can always just pick those by hand instead of doing the select-all.  In that case, the process is very fast since the app is only dealing with the few pictures you selected and not analyzing a 1000 of them.",negative,positive

I really love the picture quality of this TV. The picture was good out of the box but once I adjusted the picture setting I found on RTINGS the picture was awesome. I uninstalled or disabled all of the apps that I do not use and some of the system apps as well. I set the decreased the transition time in Android to improve the perceived speed and this has made it much better to use. I still cant get the Alexa skill to work completely. The volume an channel functions work but Alexa cant seem to turn the TV on or off. Which is the one voice feature I wanted to use. Every so often I will have to go into the setting and reset the TV as some apps will lock up and I have not found an easy way to force close them. I left one star off for those two reasons. The layout of the remote is okay. They put a lot of buttons on it and it can be weird to hold at times when pressing certain buttons especially the ones in the lower half. Overall it is a great TV that we use primarily with streaming content.,positive,positive

That might not be a big enough reason on its own, but the fact that it has a hard plastic spike there means that it gets incredibly painful to wear after a couple of minutes (I should mention that I am bald so that doesn't help). I guess the lack of padding and the spike are there because it helps the headphones fold up. I wrap a cloth around the area before I put them on and that helps. However, this looks silly and had I known this I would not have purchased the headphones.",neutral,negative

"I find myself disappointed. These buds held such promise but for me, they just didn't rise to the challenge. At first, the many options available to find the perfect fit were impressive. There's a wide selection of tips, and even some wings, for that extra snug fit. Seems like there should be a good fit in there somewhere, right? Not so much. Using the blue tips and wings, jamming the buds deep into my ears, I can get very good sound, plenty of bass. But it's really kind of painful. Using the red tips and the wings, I can get a comfortable fit that seems well seated, but then the sound is shallow, with no depth. Though still crisp, it's almost tinny. Other aspects: Setup is easy, as with all things Alexa and there are some controls you can tweak in the app, though I found adjustments had limited results. I haven't used the buds for anything but music so far, so haven't given them any commands.  The sound cancellation and pass-through features do seem to make a difference, though not to an impressive level. Battery life seems good so far. So while they got some things right, comfort and sound quality are two heavy hitters and if you don't have them - at the same time - you've got a problem. Again, I'm very disappointed and my search for the Perfect Ear Buds continues.",negative,positive
"Overall, this keyboard works as intended.  I bought this for use with my Surface Pro tablet.  I have the touch keyboard that snaps on, but it isn't easy to type on.

"This card is exactly what I wanted, small with low power requirements.  I used it in a home theater computer and it played every HD movie I tested smoothly and cleanly.  The problem is there is something funny with it's temperatures.  At first it was fine, running 42 to 53 degrees but then on the 3rd day I turned it off to install a network card and burned myself on the video card's heat sink.  When I had the computer back up and running I checked the video card's temperature and it was idling at 103 degrees, Celsius.  I let it run for a few more minutes while I installed Evga's precision software to verify that temp and it agreed with hwmonitor.  I shut it down.  A couple hours later I brought it up again, this time it was idling at 63 degrees and didn't vary much from that temp for the next several hours.  The next day it was up in the eighties and then again nineties. Today it stayed around 71.<br /><br />I really don't have a good idea what is wrong with it and I'm not going to spend anymore time worrying about it for a brand new card.

The main problem I have with a product that i otherwise love is that to use it between a waist belt and a tripod you must regularly readjust the plate on the camera by rotating it 90 degrees but because it fastens using an allen wrench rather than a captive D ring on the fastener you need to always carry the allen wrench. The other problem is that the adapters to make the plate Manfrotto compatible are hard to attach and the heads of the tiny screws used to attach them strip out well before one can feel confident they are tight.,neutral,positive
"Overall AirPods are a good product and they do well for what they are intended. Apple’s standard ear bud design (like these) really  sucks, and so my wife likes these, but I refuse to use any Apple’s standard bud design devices anymore, because the design sucks so bad and they constantly fall out (AirPods Pro in-ear design is far better, but AirPods Pro are even more of a rip-off than these standard AirPods). My bottom-line recommendation, is if you can live with the heavier and larger Amazon Echo Buds, the latter are a FAR better value for the money, and work just as well as AirPods.",neutral,positive

"First, mine didn’t smell.<br /><br />Now that I have the positive attributes out of the way let’s discuss why you should avoid this case.<br />I reluctantly paid $33 for this and I have to wonder what I was thinking. It’s nowhere near worth that much.<br /><br />It will not/cannot survive a side impact. Well that’s not true. It cannot protect your APM from a hit or drop that could damage them from the top. I’m not sure if it could from the bottom or sides. It’s either molded cardboard or thin plastic covered with fabric. No padding, just fabric.<br /><br />Internally there is another layer of cardboard (or plastic, thin, very thin) covered in a felt like material. There’s absolutely no drop protection.<br /><br />The magnets designed to put the APM into “sleep” mode lay flat. You will have to pinch them up while putting your headphones into it if you wish to keep them from clanging together and not using the stock case. Even then the magnets don’t work every time. See my pic.<br /><br />Overall this is a $10 case marked up cause they can. I mean we have expensive headphones so why not charge us more? We have already proven we will pay.<br /><br />Skip this thing. Mine is going back. If you want something to protect them in a backpack then still look elsewhere. You can get something equal to this for less.<br /><br />Thanks for your time.",negative,negative

"I bought this for travelling.<br />The good:  By theory, it's light weight and battery life would make it awesome.  That was the case, it was awesome while it lasted.<br />The bad:  I had multiple software issues right off that bat, but installed a solid state drive and a fresh copy of win 8.1 and it worked fine for a while.  Right after the warranty ended, the battery stopped charging.  I tried another battery (which was very hard to find and expensive) and found it still wouldn't charge.  Before this happened it would sometimes not start unless I removed the battery and held the power button down for about 10 sec, then it would run fine until shut down again.<br />Now it's a parts machine.  What a waste of $$$, very disappointed with my decision to go with this laptop.  I bought mine elsewhere, but figured I'd warn others of my experience since I see this laptop is still available.",negative,positive

"They are good cameras for the price. They work good and you can actually get some distance from the wifi router and they still work. Daytime is flawless. Night time use is better if you have a security light or motion lights because the IR night vision is terrible, it whites out faces if they get within 6 feet or so of the camera. The motion detection is good out to 25-30 feet. You get 30 days free trial subscription and have to pay for it after that, to me it's worth it to pay. Without the subscription you have local storage via USB drive but it does not save videos without the subscription. You can also set scheduled times for the cameras to be on or off which saves battery life. All things considered I'm happy with it and it works fine for monitoring my house when I'm not home. There is no way someone could break into my house without catching their face on camera so it serves its purpose.",positive,positive

"Have been OTA (antenna) for decades. My old one got beat up in a storm, 1/2 destroyed.  Still worked pretty well except in rain.  Replaced with this unit.  Upgraded my coax cable (better quality/new, no breaks from antenna to house).  Lost 5 channels (of 25).  I am well within a 30 mile range of all transmitters in my area.  I get the 'majors: ABC, CBS, PBS, NBC, but honestly not as clean.  Amplifier makes no difference.  I picked this one based on reviews.  Need to decide if I'll spend another 2 hours and another 50-75 bucks to go back to an old fashioned large antenna.

"I've tried 3 small antennas over the last 7 years.  The first was a little 2 Element Bowtie antenna that I bought about 7 years ago for around $25.  Although it got all the channels I watch, some were weak.  And when they switched to Digital, those channels simply disappeared unless I moved the antenna.  About 2 months ago I bought a Esky® Amplified HD Digital Outdoor HDTV Antenna with Motorized 360 Degree Rotation.  This antenna was about $35 and it picked up one more channel than my Bowtie.  Still missing a few channels that I used to get, so I bought the ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna for $100 today.  It actually missed that extra channel that I could get with the cheap Esky.  I'm on top of a hill, 40 air miles from one station and 30 from the others.  It's that one 40 mile station that I USED to get on the Bowtie, that now I cant get with ANY of these. The amplifier in the Esky brings in the one extra channel that the others dont, but even it will not bring in that 40 mile station.  To me, all of these antenna's are about the same, only the price is different.",neutral,negative

"As other reviewers have mentioned, this system is LOUD and has EXCELLENT sound overall.  I'm keeping the system, but wanted to point out a few problems that I see with the design:<br /><br />(1) Contrary to reports saying there is a power button on the sub-woofer (an inconvenient location to be sure), my system actually has NO power button at all.  This means I have to use a power strip with a switch or manually unplug the system whenever I'm done using it.  Quite a hassle.<br /><br />(2) The speakers are nice, but the stands look a little cheap.  Stamped metal.<br /><br />(3) There is a sub-woofer adjustment knob, but no tone adjustment knob.  It would have been nice to design-in a  basic EQ or at least a bass/treble adjustment knob as the speakers are a little bass heavy.<br /><br />(4) The system is made in China and smells as such.  Your house will smell like Benzene for an hour or so.  And you'll have lots of non-recyclable Styrofoam packaging to deal with.<br /><br />(5) Lastly, I don't want to complain, but the speakers are SO loud that you'll often have to be careful to keep the volume knob less than 1/4 of max.  I wouldn't want to be anywhere near the computer with these speakers on 10.<br /><br />I'm satisfied with the purchase and performance overall, but I would have been willing to pay double if the system would have had a little more attention to detail.",neutral,positive

"I purchased this item on August 20, 2017 and this is a 6 month service life review.<br /><br />ARLO - I deployed these batteries in a South Florida system and have experienced nothing but trouble with them.  They do not deliver the durability (service life) of a Streamlight or a Duracell, but more importantly when they do hold a useful charge they cause the camera to repeatedly go offline. That means you have to take the camera down, open the case, reboot it and reposition it.  At first I thought the cameras had gone bad but having seen the other reviews for this product I took out the Tenergy batteries and replaced them with Streamlight.  It has now been two weeks since I made that change and the cameras that continually went offline are now online and the Streamlight charge has held at &#62;90%.<br /><br />We have had a cold snap in South Florida during the time this problem took place and when I found the solution; which was to scrap these batteries and by extension the vendor that sold them. I have no data to share with you about the effect that cold weather (near but not freezing) contributes to the service life. I can say that the Streamlight which I have 12 months of data for has performed satisfactorily across a wide range of temperature conditions without creating any problems.<br /><br />But, I want to caution any user of Arlo Cameras looking for a really good battery solution: I have not found a winner yet.  Arlo cameras eat batteries beyond all reason. If you use Arlo plan for the expense and no matter which vendor you use this is an expense you must plan for.<br /><br />SECURITY DEVICES - These batteries should not be used in the Wireless Sensors for your Alarm System for the same reasons mentioned above.  Because these were reasonably priced we thought they would be a good value. Unfortunately they have been a miserable disappointment. In all cases these were deployed in a temperature controlled environment and we experienced an 80% reduction in service life from the Duracell we had been using.<br /><br />My suggestion is that you not take the risk of buying this Tenergy product for use in any sensitive application.",negative,positive

Talked to Ring directly, and they gave me a code for 30% off a new one (which ended up being cheaper than this refurb).

"Below is my original review and I really meant what I said. HOWEVER, having now used this stick several times, I have changed my opinion of it. I used it according to directions, cleaning it with the sticky paper, etc. But now, after maybe 10 uses, all it seems to do is leave residue on my sensor. It picks up dust but leaves residue that I then have to clean off. So, I don't recommend it unless you think getting about 5 or 6 good cleanings with it is worth it.<br /><br />I have cleaned my own DSLR sensors for years, usually using a blower, brush and - sometimes - the wet method. That all seemed well enough except, in my dry and dusty climate, a little dust always seemed a problem. I never could quite get every speck of dust, at least every time. With this Gel Stick, I finally can. I was pretty hesitant to try this (especially this &#34;less expensive&#34; version of a gel stick) but I have been very pleased. This really gets all the dust, every last speck. I did notice that, with the first couple of uses, it did seem to leave a touch of residue but then would also seem to be able to get its own residue off. So, I didn't take a star off for that but only mention it as something to watch for and not panic over.<br />Now my process is the camera self cleaning mode (I have a Sony and it vibrates the sensor a little to knock stuff off), then the blower then this Gel Stick. It's great and I highly recommend it.",negative,positive

"I purchased these cameras because the reviews seemed good for the price, and from that perspective I guess I'm not too disappointed.  There are aspects of the cameras I do not like but as this is my first foray into wireless cameras I don't know if they all have these problems or if I'm expecting too much.  I purchased these because I have 4 dogs and a lot of misbehavior when my back is turned (counter surfing, chewing the furniture, etc) so I need to figure out who's behaving badly and provide timely correction to make them stop.  After using them for two days I can say that I've had quite the eye-opening experience about what my dogs are doing when I'm not looking!  So they are definitely accomplishing the intended purpose.<br /><br />What I like:<br />1. IR works great, no issues so far.  The picture is very bright.<br />2. The range suits my needs so far, I actually want to move one to another building a few yards away but haven't yet (more for security in general, once my dogs are behaving better).  In the meantime inside my home I've had no issues.<br />3. The picture is not great resolution but it's clear enough to see what's going on. (with exception of low FPS, see below)<br />4. The cameras were easy to set up on my network.  I'm not a network genius by any stretch of the imagination but am generally experienced with computers and had no trouble following directions.  But I tried to set up access to the cameras over the internet and couldn't figure it out.  I'm not really interested in that feature, though, so it doesn't bother me much (yet).<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />1. The panning controls are very jerky and difficult to position the camera where I want it<br />2. The panning is too slow, if I'm trying to follow something relatively fast-moving it can't always keep up.<br />3. The software you get with the cameras is awful... not only that, each camera came with a different version so I had to learn how to use different software for each camera!  It's difficult to use, not very intuitive, and I was unable to find all the features I needed.  I also had to constantly reboot the cameras to keep the software talking to them as it seemed to crash all the time (Based on some others' recommendations I have been trying Blue Iris and so far like it better, although the $50 license fee seems steep for what you get...but I digress, this is a camera review, not a Blue Iris review.)<br />4. The cameras don't &#34;lose&#34; the connection to Blue Iris but have another weird quirk that they reposition themselves sometime in the middle of the night to point straight up - I don't know if this is a problem with the third-party software (maybe a config somewhere I've missed so far) or an issue with the cameras.  Since much happens on my ceilings I have to reposition them every morning.  My dogs sleep in my room with me so the camera's quirky behavior doesn't stop me from watching them, but it would be preferable if I could rely on these for security at night.<br />5. The cameras are not wide angle enough to cover an entire room, so no matter where I put them (even in a corner), there's some space in the room that's not covered.<br />6. Perhaps by biggest gripe is the FPS--it's horrible!  It seems to run between 3 and 4 and the recorded videos are very jerky--to the point where it's sometimes difficult to tell exactly who the culprit is when there are multiple dogs in the room.<br />7. The motion sensing doesn't start a recording until a couple of seconds into the motion (and sometimes not at all)--not helpful when my dog can run into the room, counter surf, and run out in less than 5 seconds.  However no idea if this is a problem with the camera or the software (or perhaps my incorrect software configuration).<br /><br />I'll update after I've used them more to let you know my success in improving my dogs' behavior.  So far despite my aggravations they are giving me what I need to solve my problem, so I'm pretty happy about that.  (and the looks on their faces now that I've suddenly developed ESP ...priceless!)",neutral,negative

"I've had an Acer Chromebook before that I liked a lot, which is why I looked into this one as a replacement. Not only is it heavier and more of the laptop end than my previous Chromebook, it's fairly heavy for s Chromebook at all. That's not bad, just not the light tablet Chromebook I'm used to.<br /><br />The display is really good. I'm not crazy about the camera quality, though it will work. I do find the audio is not great. I have to turn it way up to hear at average volume. The problem there is no one else can hear me. If we're one-on-one, they can just turn up their volume. But if I'm in a group that's not a solution. The mic on it is terrible. That's worth a whole star, alone, since I got this mostly for mobile teleconferences.<br /><br />I don't typically install much on Chromebooks. They're work-based. For now this one runs smoothly and quickly, though a couple of times it's hitched for no obvious reason. One time it went black for long seconds and wouldn't reboot. And then it was fine, also for no obvious reason.<br /><br />With hope that there's less of that and more ease, it's a good device for the price. I'm happy with it overall, but the sound and video quality aren't very good.",neutral,positive

"This is a fantastic idea and seemed like the solution to the space issues I was having with my DVR (which is a Scientific Atlanta 8300 series). But...<br /><br />DVR Expander #1: I ordered it (wish it would SAY it comes with eSATA cable so you wouldn't buy one) and hooked it up according to the directions. Nothing. Unhooked and reconnected about five times, according to directions. Nothing. Had a pretty difficult time getting through to WD customer service online (another story for another day) but when I did, they said if I couldn't format the hard drive on my computer, I should send it back. I have no eSata port on my laptop so I had to send it back (Amazon was GREAT about this).<br /><br />DVR Expander #2: I hooked it up and it formatted and everything seemed to work like a charm. DVR ""used space"" went from 67% to 3%. Hooray! I taped a couple of HBO movies to watch later. The next night, I taped several shows, some at the same time. Went to bed. The next morning, everything had deleted off my DVR except for 2 old shows. What the heck!? Then I noticed that of two shows I had scheduled to record at the same time, only one was recording. Could not make the second show record no matter what I did. The next day I tried again. I would tape two shows at once and sometimes one of the shows would tape and sometimes NEITHER. It got to the point that I could record NOTHING. At all.<br /><br />I wondered if (hoped) it was the DVR so I called my cable company and they said they'd send out a tech. But before he came, I unhooked the Expander and suddenly, the cable box worked just fine -- recording two shows at once, etc.  I canceled the cable appt but asked the Tech on the phone what was his experience with these Expanders and he said they rarely work and sometimes they ""fry the hard drive"" in the DVR as soon as you hook them up. I didn't really expect him to rave about them, but based on my experience, I also can't call him a liar.<br /><br />I asked WD about this issue and was first told that it was highly unusual to have two Expanders not work (implying *I* was the problem?) and that maybe I should try another cable box. I pressed them and asked if this was a common problem -- surely I'm not the only person to have this happen?? After that, the WD person wrote back and said this:<br /><br />""I have done some further research on your scenario and found that these model drives, WDG1S5000, WDG1S10000 have not been tested and are not supported on the SA 8300HDC, this<br />mean it may or may not work.""<br /><br />SO -- even though WD says this product will work with the SA 8300 series, it may not. I asked them if an older model WD Expander might work (maybe a 500G) but they haven't responded.<br /><br />Also, I noticed that the one or two shows I was able to watch on playback while I had it hooked up were really pixelated -- lots of ""noise"" (I guess that's the right term) and skipping and disruption.<br /><br />I really really really really wanted it to work.",negative,positive

"Hooked everything up and started on screen setup. One of the first steps is to maximize the size of the viewing area, expanded to fill the screen as directed and completed setup.

"The good: it fits/charges in my 17.3 HP laptop. It seems to charge as quickly if not a bit quicker than the original factory charger. At $12 it was cheap...er, inexpensive. The plug is actually a better more snug fit than the original.<br />The not-so-good: the cord is pretty short, roughly 5 ft. so be certain you have a AC outlet within 3ft or so. The transformer box heats up rather quickly but doesn't appear to get too hot--we'll see.<br />Also, mine came with a small usb plug-in dongle attached to the cord about 6 inches away from the L-plug. This feature is not in any of the product shots/descriptions or referenced in any review I've read so I'm not sure what to make of it. The dongle is permanently attached to the cord and frankly only adds a cumbersome element to the power cord. I mean most computers have a full compliment of usb plug-ins so this just seems like a superfluous element more likely to snag on something than actually provide any real benefit.<br />Time will tell how sturdy this charger is, so the other points notwithstanding, I'll upgrade a star after it's use and dependability is determined.",positive,positive

"UPDATE:  I waited for the second generation of these cameras, and tried them again.  Initially it seemed like a home run!  BUT....  when a micro SD card was installed in any of the 4 cameras I purchased, it would record until the card was full, and even though the setting were for it to erase/continue to record, ALL of the cameras with cards installed stopped recording, and rendered the micro SD cards unusable....that right....COMPLETELY UNUSABLE IN ANY DEVICE.  In other words these cameras EAT MICRO SD CARDS.  I tried different brands and capacities, including those branded as Wyze cards.....same result.  So once again, I try to seek/get support from the company, and just like before, got no help or response to anything until I went on the public forum and started complaining about this issue.  It wasn't until a large number of other customers joined in the thread and stated they were having the same problems.  This dragged on for nearly a year, with Wyze doing everything to pin the blame on owners/users.  Wyze even asked me to return ALL the cameras I had purchased...and when I asked for replacements, they told me that they would return my cameras when they were done investigating them.... and just how long will that take?  They didn't know, and would not send replacements while they studied mine..... wow....what a screw job!  After more and more people came forward on the forums, Wyze contacted me via email, and said that they were going to refund my money for all the cameras I owned, provided I would no longer say anything on the forums.  In other words... ""hush money"".  I agreed, and now here it is more then TWO YEARS later, and that thread is still very active on the Wyze forums..... and Wyze has never found or fixed the problem..... but they've had plenty of time create new products.<br />  OK, all that being said, the WyzeCam is a decent product, but it IS NOT AS ADVERTISED!  It's great if you just want LIVE surveillance coverage ONLY, but it's useless if you wish to install and use recording media (micro SD card). Also, don't believe their ""2 week cloud storage""..... because you can't get to, no matter how hard you try.<br /><br />I purchase two of these cameras directly from Wyze Labs, and for the price, expected SOME shortcomings..... what I got was products that are totally unreliable, requiring constant resets/re-connection to get any use at all out of them.  Both cameras would constantly fail to connect to ANY device, making them useless to me.<br /><br />  After 2 weeks of hassles, I tried to contact support, and waited..... nothing!  So I went to the forum on their website and at first, attempted to get some help there.  Based on many forum posts, these devices were obviously rushed to market, without enough testing of either hardware or software.  People spoke of interference from any number of other devices, and one individual basically had to shut down ALL other electronics in his home to get a reliable connection!<br />  It was not until I openly started complaining on the forums, that Wyze finally responded to the support request I had submitted.  They then wanted to play the twenty questions game......even though I had explained my level of electronics knowledge, and all the circumstances/steps involved in the initial support request.  At that point it had been nearly a month since receiving the cameras, and submitting the support request.  I finally told support that I was not interested in playing games, and to their credit, the issued me a refund.<br /><br />  I really wanted to like these devices, but it was very obvious that they simply were rushed to market without enough testing of both hardware and software.  Because they issued me a refund, I am open to trying the next generation of  these devices, but will demand that they work as advertised.  Some may say that it's only a $25 camera, so don't expect too much....but that is no excuse for a device that simply does not work as advertised.",negative,positive

"I have owned this unit for two years now.  This would be a 4.5 to 5 star unit EXCEPT for the cable!!  I use it both on D300 and D2X.<br /><br />PRO:<br /><br />1.  It is reasonably accurate, although my Delorme PN-40 gives a slightly different reading.  This is common amongst different brands.<br /><br />2.  It aquires at Cold start about as fast as any GPS.<br /><br />3.  It is reasonably priced (though it was $85 two years ago.)<br /><br />4.  Even near some trees in Grand Canyon National Park (yes, the North Rim has shade)it caught and held signals.<br /><br />CON:<br />1.  Altitude-  It can be all over the place.  From one frame to the next without moving.  Fortunately, I use Geosetter and grab the true altitude from the web.<br /><br />2.  The cable makes it ONE STAR.  It is too short.<br /><br />3.  The cable is built wrong.  The cable (10-pin end) comes down at a 45-deg. angle away from the camera.  This leads to strain and ultimate failure--in four days in my case.  Since it is not a Nikon cable, they could build it with the wire coming UP and out at a 45.<br /><br />4.  The cable is too short to really attach to the camera strap. Stress once again.  This should be a longer, coiled cable--especially for $19.<br /><br />5.  The cable, if coiled and longer (and connector properly angled) could be placed high on the camera strap, or pinned to my vest or shirt.<br /><br />6.  The battery-- not even close to 10 hours before sucking from the Nikon.  Not a big deal with the Nikon batteries I use.<br /><br />7.  The cable-- $19.95 PLUS $9 shipping.  Really now!!  This would fit in a .50 padded bag and go 1st Class (free Delivery Confirmation if done electronically) for another $1.50-2.00.  (This looks like the Feebay tactic.) Basically, the cable appears to be $25+shipping.<br /><br />8.  The cable-- no real strain relief at the camera connector.  I have gone to garbaging it up with heat shrink tape and tubing.<br /><br />9.  The cable-- When you build your own you should bring the cable fitting further from the metal screw collar.  You MUST screw it in tight or it works loose in short order.  I am presuming Nkon uses a mucher tighter thread tolerance because mine don't unscrew and don't have to be wrenched in.  The problem is: you have to get that final tightness using your finger nail in the reeding on the nut.  BUT, getting it out I have to start it with a jewelers-size neddle nose.<br /><br />OTHER THOUGHTS:<br />What would REALLY improve this would be another switch giving an option that leaves it on all the time.  Restarting is probably what uses battery.<br /><br />Too bad too because this would be a really 5-star deal.  Did I say, ""THE CABLE?""  So, I have to spend $28 (actually $56 to have a spare!)  Although the input to the GPS is a mini USB, the cable has a very thick connector housing to keep it in the GPS.  My next try is to use a mini USB extention get some length and use black photo tape to keep it secure.<br /><br />I'd have one for each camera if it wasn't for, guess what?",negative,positive

"I bought this trackball because I frequently use my laptop in situations where space is at a premium, thus making mouse movements difficult. I found it to be too light in the hand, inadvertently causing me to change orientation of the ball relative to my hand and thus making movements of the ball haphazard and inaccurate. The tiny, lightweight ball is difficult for me to move with precision as well. As disclosure, I should mention that my thumbs are slightly arthritic, but I frequently use the Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman, which is a much more robust device. The larger, well placed ball of the Trackman responds more accurately to the control of my two middle fingers, and no functionality is lost due to the three button array on the thumb side of the device. Unfortunately, it also uses a relatively huge receiving device, not at all as convenient as the universal dongle the M570 uses. In my perfect world, Logitech would bring out the Trackman compatible with the unifying receiver.",neutral,positive
"I bought this Netgear router because the first one I purchased was ridiculously inefficient for service with a 1 Gig Internet connection. Both the 5 Ghz & 2.4 Ghz were not fast enough and the LAN connection was appalling in relation to the 1000 Mbps (1 Gig) Internet service that I'm using. Spend a little more money and get a model which advertises a higher speed of Wi-fi than your Internet service actually is. Buy one with a Wi-fi speed at least three times faster than you actually need, so you'll at least get near the speeds on Wi-Fi and LAN that you are paying for from your Internet service provider. That's what I did. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad router but it's not efficient enough for me, as I want to get the most out of my Internet connection. So it's your choice if you want to buy it but if you need the most speed you can get from your LAN or Wi-fi, then spend a little more and go for a higher rated Netgear model. This model works fairly okay and is very well priced but I personally prefer a more efficient model. It's your choice.",neutral,positive

The fit is great, the battery life seems to last pretty long, and they stay put in your ears well. However, any time I connect them to Bluetooth, I get a constant background white noise (at a decently low level, but still present) that is present while audio is playing and lasts for about 10 seconds after any sort of audio stops. Also, given the talk of the sound quality and the 'improved bass', I was pretty disappointed. Maybe they connected to my phone with one of the poorer quality codecs. But also, I shouldn't be expected to go research codecs to get good sound quality out of a product.<br />TL;DR - Could have been great, returning them for a refund and maybe buying the Pro model instead.",negative,positive
"Ok, so I didn’t trust the techies and decided to do my own test to use this residentially. Mounted it vertical and service was good but no distance or high speed.

It’s obvious that this is designed to push the radiation pattern horizontally and downward. This is fantastic to use for home coverage and better/faster than all the Comcast/Cox plug in pods.  Netgear should market this inexpensive, easy to set up on “standalone” mode for home use. BTW, forget a DC adapter, buy a Power Over Ethernet adapter so you don’t need an outlet just LAN wire. PS….keep you LAN wire corners at 45 degree turns and watch the higher speeds you’ll get!",positive,positive

"This is one very cool little GPS.  You honestly do not have to read the instructions to use it. I've never seen anything as user friendly as this.  We got it for our daughter who is clearly tec challanged.  Without a bit of problem it took her to the driveway of a very rural home where she had a home visit scheduled in a town she'd never been to before and didn't even know 'about' where it was in the State. The voice instructions are clear and loud enough that you can still have your radio on, and if you STILL mess up (even with your guide reminding you 3 times where and which way you will be turning)it just re-routes you on the next best route without fuss or fanfare. When I opened the box I was disappointed at the size of the screen--it's a little thing.  However, turns out it is actually big enough to be useable.  It gives you basically everything you need to know about where to make the next turn with a  well lighted directional arrow on a small bit of a map. If you make the wrong turn you can see within a few feet where and how you messed up.<br /><br />  We have a 'real' garmin gps with uses a laptop computer. It too is great, but it is a lot more difficult to use. On the other hand with the 'real' one you don't just find yourself blindly following a voice that tells you to turn right in 100 feet. If the idea of pretty much just knowing where and when the next turn you will be taking is, give you a panic attack, then you will want the full sized Gps. On the other hand, if you just want to know how the heck to get to a million or so places and back home again, then this little unit will make you very, very happy.",positive,positive

"I'm probably still adjusting to the feeling of the keyboard cover, but I have a couple of niggles with it.  First, the fit isn't perfect and it occasionally wrinkles a bit while I'm typing.  Second, the molding for the cover includes a slight ridge on every key which is great at first touch because the physical keyboard has not tactile feedback about where the edges of the keys are that could be easily remedied with a key indentation on the face or with a slight edge on the key to help your fingers know where the keys are on the chiclet style keys.  However, the molding on the cover is a bit too strong, too rigid and makes it too easy to move the cover which is what I believe is causing the cover to move while typing.  That aside, the cover provides excellent feel compared to the smooth keys of the keys themselves.  The silicone has just enough texture to make it very pleasant to touch.  If the actual keys had this texture and some kind of tactile feedback to define the keys like an edge or indentation, it would be perfect.  However, as a cheap add-on to help protect the keyboard and provide some better tactile feedback, the cover does work.  One last mention, the cover has a couple of different led pass throughs compared to the led reveals on the backlit keyboard itself, like the power button.  Not a big deal and I didn't even notice it until my first typing session in the dark when the leds were more noticeable for being covered up by the different reveals in the cover.",neutral,positive

I like that the hard plastic piece that goes around the part that plugs into the phone is about an inch long, which makes it easy to unplug.

"I can't say for sure how well it functions as a surge protector, as I haven't been using it through any notable ones - at least, as far as I know - but otherwise, as a general port expander and travel hub, it works pretty well.  The rotatable pins on the back is really useful for adapting it to the various odd angles and placements of wall sockets in hotels and so forth.  The USB ports seemed to charge iPhones & iPads roughly as fast as using the official adapters.<br /><br />In practice what I found slightly lacking was:<br /><br />1) The size & weight.  It's bigger than I expected, and much heavier than I expected.  Certainly &#34;travel&#34;-size in the context of a suitcase, but a bit bulky w.r.t. a backpack or day-bag.<br />2) It'd be nice to have more USB ports.  Most of what I used it for was USB charging, and having to bring extra wall warts to provide extra USB ports was suboptimal.<br />3) It gets surprisingly warm if you have all five ports connected to even just low-power devices (like battery chargers & iDevices).  Not uncomfortably warm to the touch, but warm enough that I wondered whether I should leave it unsupervised.<br />4) The power sockets are pretty close together, as you can see.  You can *just* fit old-style iDevice adapters side-by-side.  Anything larger, and you're going to lose access to the middle port at least.  Competing devices have the sockets either further apart or on different sides of the device, which would consequently be more likely to accept more devices simultaneously, in practice.",neutral,positive
"I am 11 years old in the six grade and ended up having to get a rolling backpack because our lockers are too far away and I have to carry everything with me for the entire day.  Here are the things I like best about it: (1)  I really like all the different compartments-- they are big  and you can fit a lot in them. (2)  Rolling it works very well-- easy to control.  (3) The handle is strong and raises and lowers easily. (4)  I love the color I have. It's black with  blue flowers  (5)  i've had it for three months and all of the zipper still work really well. (6)  I like that the shoulder straps don't get all caught up in the wheels.  There are some other brands that the straps just get in the way or drag on the ground in these down at all.<br /><br /> Here are the things I'm not as crazy about: (1)  it's big but my stuff still is really packed in there so I wish it were just a little bit bigger.  (2)  it's heavy. Being heavier makes it stronger but it's very heavy to lift so you could never wear it like a backpack on your shoulder if it's full at all with any books. (3) You have to be a little careful with the balance of it because  when it stands by itself it can be a little tippy. (4)  The handle is getting a little worn out. I know it's because the backpack is so heavy and that it Hass to be lifted in and out of the back of the van but it's only made out of fabric, the same material that the backpack is made out of and I'm worried that over time it will get torn  from being polled so much.<br /><br /> All in all I'm very happy with this backpack. My twin brother has the same model but with different colors.  We are both very glad we've got these and don't have to become hunchbacks carrying all the heavy things we did in the backpacks that we used to have to wear on her shoulders.  This one was a little bit more money than some of the other brands but not as expensive as those that are a lot of money so my mom is really happy with it and so are we. It's worth the extra money.<br /><br />UPDATE: We bought two--one for each of our twins. Less than 3 months later and the handle is becoming loose and wobbly on one of them and the other is coming unstitched. Because it's over 30 days we can't get a refund. Amazon is sending two more. My feeling is that this is just an inferior product--not that we 'just happened to receive two bad ones.'

"After my last Crosley started to slip I purchased this old-timey traveling version and I'd admit that I probably listen to less records on this player than I did on my old one because the sound quality isn't great and the unstable turntable tends to warp songs. For the quality, this is definitely overpriced and should probably be in the $50 range. If you're looking for a high quality turntable this -- and I'd argue any Crosley -- isn't it. Crosley players, in my opinion, provide a great vehicle to play records at home in the background when you're focused on something other than the music playing, and certainly as a secondary music source. On this model, the sound quality is muddled from a slightly unstable turntable, which lends to the old-timey charm of this player, but isn't going to be mp3 quality, which is why I was surprised that this player offered the ability to record an mp3 from a record. I certainly wouldn't want an mp3 version of the sound coming out of this player, even from brand new records. On the positive side, the player stops a record from spinning when it finishes a side, and while I have the record player permanently set on a table, the suitcase-like design does enable easy travel if that's important. It is a beautiful piece of decor, just not particularly functional.",negative,positive

The FP audio from this card sounds like trash, and switching between my headphones and my speakers was a pain in my rear; reach down, switch them, go the control panel, change the options in there, yada yada it sucked. Sounded great until that one jack busted and I was forced to use FP. I've since grabbed a new sound card. On the software side, the EQ options are fantastic, but past that it's all just a bunch of Realtek-esque crap.",negative,positive

"It's hard to find ear buds that aren't specifically made for iPhones so this is a great find. I use it successfully on my Samsung Focus smartphone.<br /><br />The sound quality is crisp and well-defined. Every pitch from the really low to the really high is clear. The 'extreme' port isn't as boom-y as you would think and I use it for all types of music, though music with really heavy bass like Deadmau5 or rap can be a little intense (but I'm too lazy to change the port to a less boom-y level.) The cord is better than other ear buds because it has less 'micro-phonics', meaning when it rubs against your clothes you get less loud, irritating noise coming into your ears.<br /><br />The remote control/mic is very nice to have and is an important reason why I bought these. You can switch to talking on the phone and you can use it to skip forward or backward between tracks. However, I have 2 complaints about it. First, it is very difficult to find the actual button that you need to push to operate it. It is flush with the body of the remote so you can't feel it. I have to reach for the remote and actually look for the markings on it to find the button. Also, I wish it had volume control.<br /><br />It is also great because it has an angled jack which, in my experience, lasts much longer than the straight ones that tend to short out quickly because of the way they get pulled back and forth within the phone/mp3 player you are using.<br /><br />I use the flanged ear tips that it is packaged with and they don't fall out. The little case that is included is hard-sided and provides a lot more protection than fabric pouches. It could be a little larger, though, so that the cord could be coiled more loosely.<br /><br />Overall, after lots of research and testing, these are the best I've found. The complaints I have are minor compared to the brilliance of the sound quality. I highly recommend them.<br /><br />***** UPDATE TO REVIEW:<br /><br />After 4 months, the earphones still sound great. There is one complaint that I didn't mention in the original review: the cord tangles and can be a little irritating to untangle. But I imagine that is a problem with all earbuds. I still like them overall.",positive,positive

I like the overall design, water repellant outside and had bump guards on the inside that protects the iPad. I keep the pad in the case and use it in my laptop bag as a extra layer of protection. I saw some reviews grumbling about the size, which is clearly written in the description, so there’s that. I would recommend this, it offers more protection, very lightweight, yet sturdy design, zippers are smooth. It has some lovely colors, but this color was on sale, so if that’s not an issue for you save some money there. It helps keep my anxiety low popping it into my bag with this cover, I saved an paid a lot of money for my iPad so I want to protect it as much as I can.

ABSOLUTE S*^&... I thought I'd try out Seagate after 10 years of being a WD customber because Seagate seems to have a better grip on data speeds; but MAN am I now kicking myself.

These drives can not be moved at ALL after you unplug them from the computer otherwise their heads get screwed up.

"When reviewing headsets, I don't just pop them on and hit play on a favorite song or take a call. I actually run them through a battery of sound tests from an audio site. I run all sets through the same test to make it fair. First on my PC and then on my iPhone XS. I find it's the best way to make an unbiased review.<br />• Bass: Poor with a limited range. It also wasn’t balanced between the earbuds.<br />• High freq: Better than the bass, but still a limited range. It was balanced between the earbuds much better though.<br />• Rattle: None, but it would be weird if earbuds rattled. Ok that’s not true, I stepped on a pair at the gym that rattled afterwards. Oops.<br />• Volume: Sufficient. I don’t blast my earbuds, because I like to keep my hearing. I could turn it low enough to not hear, and loud enough to be uncomfortable.<br />• Clarity: Isolated for the sound test they did fine. However, outside the site the clarity started to degrade, and on a call was bad enough to be an issue.<br /><br />The sound check results were mediocre. Bass was lacking, as was the general range of the set. These actually did worse than their cheaper behind the neck set (Jabra Evolve 65e UC).<br /><br />As for things other than sound, like usability I like to ask myself what I’m looking for and if product meets those expectations. So, here goes:<br /><br />Would these last the entire workday?<br />Yes and No, if you take them off to charge during lunch then you will probably be fine. Otherwise no they are going to die out about 75% through a standard 8 hr workday. They require a USB port and their little case thing to charge. I had no issues as long as I remember to charge them at lunch.<br /><br />Are they easy to use?<br />The basics, yes. All the extra features, not so much. I opened the box up and was happy to see the quick-start guide, unfortunately if there is a manual I didn't get one. I found a digital copy tucked away in the iPhone app, but nothing in the box itself. That made anything past the basics in the quick-start guide a matter of trial and error, until I found the manual tucked away in the App. For the price, that seems like a rather cheap move. There is a ton of useful info in the manual that is not contained in the quick-start guide.<br /><br />Can I take calls seamlessly?<br />Yes, but for me at least the call experience was lacking. The voices on some but not all calls were a bit muddled, however they could hear me just fine. So poor marks for the sound quality, but high marks for the mic.<br />Speaking of mics, can I mute the mic easily?<br />Easily, yes. But knowing for sure if you are muted (we've all been there) only when using the computer dongle, on my iPhone using Bluetooth, eek not so much. Had to leave it to faith. That was a bit scary.<br /><br />Plays music well (aka does it have range and bass)?<br />Meh. I have the sound review at the top. As you can imagine, lack of bass negatively impacts listening to music. I mean it wasn’t awful but it wasn’t great either.<br /><br />Can I opt to hear people talking to me (audio pass-through)?<br />Yes, but it sounds super static and buzzy. The sound is not clear and crisp at all. Also, you can't just pop an earbud out and listen with one ear. If the earbuds are anymore than head-width apart they stop working all together. According to the manual, you should be able to use the right earbud by itself, but that was not my experience. It also would stop working (although it worked a bit longer than the left) once they were too far apart.<br /><br />Noise-canceling abilities, can I at least block out the cubical next to me?<br />Sort of. You can block drumming blah blah blah sounds, but ringing phones and coworkers talking, not so much. Although it did take the edge off. The Jabra iPhone app for these has some cool ambient sound machine settings, waves crashing, thunderstorm, white noise, etc. Probably my favorite thing about this whole set.<br /><br />Are they comfortable?<br />I didn't like them, but I am a petite human and have small ears. I also don't like the weird vacuuming pressure you feel when wearing anything noise-cancelling. I will give these neutral marks for comfort, I think if you had larger ear canals and didn't mind closed type headsets these would probably be fine.<br /><br />Are these worth the price?<br />Nope. For the price these should be spectacular and check all the boxes. They are mediocre in sound quality even though they are packed with features. If you plan on just tossing them on and not actually testing the audio, go for it. They work. But for the price, they should handle music and calls equally well. They do not.<br /><br />Overall, I will have to say I was rather disappointed with these. I also reviewed their behind the neck version (Jabra Evolve 65e UC) and was hoping I had just gotten a dud with that set. Well lightening either struck twice, or the audio on these is even worse than the cheaper behind the neck version. Darn, because I wanted to love these. I have a soft spot for gadgets with cool features. These had potential. I will give them three stars because if the price point wasn’t so high, they would be okay. Not great, but they’d get the job done. I also really liked the ambient sounds you could listen to on the app. A nice little extra that was unexpected.<br /><br />Hope that helps!",neutral,positive

"TL:DR<br />Materials: Cheap.<br /><br />Sound quality: quite Decent but a bit heavy on the lower ends and weak on the higher ends.<br /><br />Over Ears: For people with larger than average heads or slightly larger ears than a 10 year old you will notice the headphones are more like on ear instead of being over ear.<br /><br />the quality of materials feel a bit on the cheep side of materials, The only part of this headset that is metal are the adjustment strips and the arch band on the inside of the padding so they would wear out slower, all the other parts are plastic and i could see many of them breaking quickly if the user is someone who takes their headset off many times a day and plops them on their desk.<br /><br />The Speakers/Drivers are decent for audio and the noise cancelling works as you may expect .<br /><br />My problem with these headphones is if you have a slightly larger head than average you may struggle to have them sit over your ears correctly and they will tend to drift up your head, The ear pads are also not as soft as one may think from what the description says.<br /><br />Since the ear pads are circular so they will tend to sit on either the top, bottom or back of your ear, This will cause pressure sensitivity on already soft skin, If you do buy these and notice this problem.<br /><br />it is up to you if you return them but if you plan to keep them i would 100% recommend getting replacement ear pads for them that are softer and will form over the ear instead of pressing down on them like the factory ones do.",neutral,negative
"I very nearly gave this wireless keyboard/mouse a one star rating and a lousy review. For the first few hours, I battled with unpredictable periods of truly awful keyboard lag. Like waiting 30 seconds for it to wake up and accept my keystrokes. It was very very frustrating. I was on the verge of boxing it up and sending it back when I tried positioning the PC so the USB dongle was in line of sight of the keyboard and mouse. Aha! They both worked flawlessly.  -  This was not a practical solution though as I didn't want to use up one of my front USB ports, so I added a USB extension cable to the rear USB port I was using; plugged the dongle into that and then positioned the dongle in line of sight of the keyboard and mouse but in an unobtrusive location. So, if you are on the verge of tossing yours, try this solution. It's working like a champ now. No delays.",neutral,negative

"In terms of audio performance these seem good.  They are a bit uncomfortable to wear for longer periods of time, e.g. more than say 45 minutes (rough approximation) and they start to hurt my ears a bit.  I do have asymmetrical ears, one has a larger fold on the top than the other, this could be a factor in the comfort (along with possibly other head/ear size/shape differences among people).  As a result of this discomfort alone it is hard for me to give them more than 3 stars.  I found the best way for me to wear them when I am not on the move is in reverse, with the neck bar over my chin. There is enough tension to keep them on as long as I am basically just lying back or reclining, and in that configuration they don't hurt my ears.<br /><br />Another con is the type-C USB connector.  Yes it is mentioned down in the wall of text of the product page so perhaps it is my fault for not noticing.  But to me there is no excuse for any product of this nature not to use a standard micro-USB connector.  Now I have to make sure I keep track of this cable for this device which is the only one of this type that I have, since all the other use micro-USB.  I can't just plug it in to all the other micro-USB cables I have lying around my apartment.<br /><br />I'm also not getting any kind of audible low battery warning, which other similar headsets always had.<br /><br />The other functions such as the equalizer and locator app are fine/nice, though honestly I don't really use them.",neutral,negative

"I received the A510 Friday April 20th about noon. I followed the 1-2-3 steps. Sadly it appears step one did not work but there may be no way to determine this until you proceed with step 2 (turn it on).<br /><br />This is my first tablet but not the first Android in the house. We have a couple of phones so we are familiar with the interface and basics of setup.<br /><br />During steps 2-3 I quickly noted that the tablet was not fully charged after having spent all afternoon on the charger. I spent all evening linking it with my Google account and playing with an included game and down-loading a few apps like the Bible etc. I was pleased that after an update/install the Amazon Kindle app worked and I can see my books. During the course of the evening I attempted to use the charger. The reading of the battery capacity never goes up, only down. if it would only take a charge there is a high probability I'd like this tablet.<br /><br />The tablet works well and quickly. Everything I attempted to-do worked well. The wireless worked with my home gear. Sadly like all things that run on batteries that cannot be recharged life is limited. I've turned my unit off as I don't want it completely run down. I'm too old and life too short to spend time on the phone with tech support so I'll be returning this tablet one day after its arrival. I figure in a month or two I'll order another and hope this issue is resolved.",neutral,positive

"**after a few months of usage**<br />The biggest update is that it's worked beautifully with no reboots due to lockups or issues (it does require reboots for many settings changes), and I've never found an issue where I wanted to do something but couldn't (or couldn't figure out how to do it).  Speeds are outstanding as is coverage.  Love this router!<br /><br />**original review**<br />Out of the box it's big, but somehow not too big.  Setup can either be very easy or a little time consuming, though that's in part due to my unfamiliarity with how Asus sets things up as well as a rather complicated configuration (nearly gave up making it all work with the Onhub).  Either way, if you can dream it, you can do it.  Asus does frequent updates (compared to D-Link, Netgear, etc...), so be sure to look for the latest one.  I didn't do speed tests, but I'm getting great speeds and low latency (I do Steam in home streaming) throughout a 2 story plus a basement townhouse.  For now I've had no issues (speed drops, dropped connections, DNS issues, DHCP etc...).  I'll update this review as needed, but for now I'm delighted.  This router really can do it all.<br /><br />To be honest, I'd say that 95% of folks don't need this much router.  It's overkill and a bit pricey, but between running my own servers (including active directory and DNS), Steam in home streaming, and a few other nuances, I appreciate having a robust and future proof solution.  Recommended if you need the best, but most folks should look elsewhere (including lower cost Asus solutions such as the ASUS RT-AC87U)) to save money.",positive,positive
"Ignore the photo of the black backpack if you are concerned with the zippers.  It looks like the photo, but the zipper in the exterior pocket is a single zipper, not the dual zipper pull as pictured.  I hate this, especially since the zipper opens and closes from the end opposite of the gorilla which I wanted to slip inside the exterior pocket. Being that there is no dating on the bag or any of the tags, I can't say if this is an old or new model, but I can say that it does contain the guarantee card inside one of the pockets identifying it as a genuine Kipling product.  We still have a Kipling fanny pack from decades past and it looks perfect, but I was happy to see that this black fabric is not the crinkly style, rather is a heavier textile.  It's not as heavy as canvas, so it won't add weight if this is for a child.  Know what you are getting, this model has no bottle holders or bells and whistles, just the gorilla.  The lining is a bland beige and the laptop &#34;sleeve&#34; has satisfactory padding on all sides, including the base.  My 15 inch laptop fits with the flap sealed and there's still room for more height and width.  If the zipper was as pictured, I would like this backpack more, but it's not and that's too bad.  It was made in China.",neutral,positive
"I love cats and I love photography, but I hate photographing cats.  My cats squint every time the flash goes off.  I tried the Sto-Fen and they squint.  So I tried this, and they squint.  However, it does create nice, soft lighting for other subjects.  It has some gaps around the edges where some of the light escapes, but I can somewhat correct for this using the exposure compensation setting on my camera.  Anyway, I give up on the cats until I can get some always-on studio lights.",neutral,positive

My old set of $20 wireless earbuds from 2 years ago had the capability of pairing to multiple devices at the same time.  That was super useful for me as I listen to music from my phone and can also be alerted to incoming conferences/emails from my work computer.  The TOZO T6 earbuds are only capable of pairing to one device at a time.  So I have to turn off connectivity on one of my devices in order to switch between phone and computer.  Not overly happy.  Even with the battery life on my old set of ear buds being terrible... I'm considering returning these earbuds.<br /><br />I also find controlling the volume on these TOZO T6 ear buds to be a bit of an issue.  Aka... I cant when it is in the instructions that it can.

"Bought these Xpand X105-RF-X1 to use with an Espon 5050ub projector paired with an Elite screens Cinegrey 3d screen using a Panasonic Ub820 player.<br /><br />The glasses were easy to pair with the Epson projector and were comfortable to wear even over my glasses. 3d was generally excellent presenting a crisp, clean and bright image with only minimal ghosting noticed.<br /><br />I also own the Sintron ST07-BT 3D Active Shutter Glasses and find these glasses to be superior in several ways. A few of the differences noted below:<br /><br />1. These glasses are far more comfortable than the Sintron.<br />2. The lens are bigger, which also ties in with the comfort.<br />3. The image is distinctly brighter when viewed through these glasses compared to the Sintron, however, i do believe the Sintron image quality are very good.  These are just better.<br />4. 3d effects are extremely good with minimal ghosting as mentioned. I would say in this area the Sintron and the Xpand are about equal.<br />5. Battery life. This is the one area the Sintron comes out ahead. Charges seem to last forever for the Sintron glasses.<br />6. The Sintron comes with a nice fabric bag for each pair of glasses and a lens cloth. The Xpand don't come with anything.<br />7. Price: currently the Sintron are roughly half the price of the Xpand.<br /><br />The question becomes are the Xpands worth double the price? I think for the avid 3d buff they're certainly worth it. The added comfort and brightness really do make it a better overall experience. If you're looking to save a few bucks get one or two of the Xpands for yourself and your significant other and the Sintrons for guests/children you might have over. The Sintrons still give an excellent 3d viewing experience and your guests are sure to be wowed.",positive,positive
"I have used this product for years, as I wear my ipod nano around my neck day and night, and every few months I need a new pair because one ear or the other stops working. When I ordered my latest replacement I received a defective product (one of the ears had a MUCH softer speaker than the other, so that stereo listening simply wasn't possible. I contacted the seller, thinking perhaps they'd want to know about it and received quite a snippy response from them. I went ahead and returned the faulty product to Amazon and purchased another set (they couldn't simply replace it and suggested I re-order) which was fine. I like the product, but won't voluntarily buy from this vendor again, unless there are no other sources. I do wish there were more lanyard-style headphones on the market, but these work well.<br /><br />Please note that I didn't write any review a couple of months, because I don't like to give negative feedback. But after the third prompt from the vendor to write a review, I decided to go ahead and share my experience. I'd give the headphones alone a four-star rating.",neutral,positive
"This device looks good, and it’s an OK hotspot. But it’s not worth $170, especially when you factor in the incredibly expensive data that is the main selling point. i’m paying 50 bucks per month for 50 GB of prepaid data on T-Mobile. GlocalMe is $36 for 10gb and that’s US only. Usually when a company is trying to entice people to subscribe to expensive recurring service, they do so by providing a cheaper device. In this case, the device is pretty expensive and so is the service. Of course, I knew about all that in advance. What I didn’t know was that the battery life was going to be so poor. I hope they manage to get their data prices down to a more realistic level. They may be good for international travel.

Very basic input, only has power, two HDMI ports, and one display port.<br /><br />Set up is fairly easy, and I’m using it with a swing arm out. Curvature is just enough to where it provides benefits, but not so much that it’s overly noticeable with documents and text.  The matte finish on the screen reduces glare, and for my application this is a benefit.<br /><br />I got this open box, and it turned out to be a great deal!",positive,positive
